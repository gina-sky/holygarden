prompt:Hyper-realistic 3D render of a [Object], presented on a soft matte grey background. The object appears to be carved from frosted translucent ice, with subtle crystalline surface details and delicate frost buildup around edges and textures. A soft white neon glow radiates from within the object, illuminating its contours with an ethereal light. The material should look like a frozen hybrid of glass and glossy snow. The scene must feel cold, silent, and surreal — as if frozen in time. Studio lighting, minimal shadows, centered framing.

好的，如果将 `[Object]`（水果）的材质从“冰雕”改为其他有趣的、合适的材质，同时保持其超现实、艺术化的呈现，这里有几个新的提示词方向供您选择：

---

**1. 晶体矿物水果 (Crystalline Mineral Fruit)**

这个概念将水果呈现为由稀有宝石或矿物构成的，具有独特的切面和内部光泽。

- **提示词：**
  `Hyper-realistic 3D render of a single [Name of Fruit], presented on a dark, reflective obsidian base. The fruit is intricately sculpted from shimmering, translucent amethyst crystal, exhibiting sharp facets and natural, unpolished edges that form its contours. Deep purple hues blend with lighter lavender tones, catching and refracting light from within, revealing internal veins and inclusions like a precious geode. The surface should have a slightly rough, crystalline texture. Soft, dramatic studio lighting with subtle rim light, emphasizing its luxurious, geological beauty. Centered framing, volumetric light haze.`
  - **替换示例：**
    - `apple` (苹果) -> 呈现为紫水晶苹果
    - `pear` (梨) -> 呈现为紫水晶梨
    - `pineapple` (菠萝) -> 呈现为紫水晶菠萝（想象一下，每一个菠萝“眼”都是一个晶体切面！）
    - `strawberry` (草莓) -> 呈现为红宝石或石榴石草莓，颜色会更契合

### **关键调整方向：**

1. **材质真实性**：通过纹理关键词（如 `wood grain`, `crackled glaze`, `sedimentary layers`）增强触感。
2. **自然光源**：用 `sunlight`, `ambient golden light`, `backlight` 等替代霓虹光，营造温暖或原始氛围。
3. **环境融合**：将背景与材质关联（如砂岩配沙漠、陶土配石板），强化场景叙事。
4. **缺陷美学**：添加 `tool marks`, `weathering`, `asymmetry` 等让物体更“天然”。

如果需要更抽象或混合材质（如“水果逐渐石化”），可加入动态描述（如 `petrified texture transitioning from flesh to stone`）。试试看！
