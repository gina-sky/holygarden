**核心概念（您的原始提示词）：** 手持纸片剪影与现实背景结合，剪影揭示外部景色。

---

**以下是几个创意艺术插图提示词：**

**1. 标题：时光之窗：古老寺庙前的神兽剪影**

- **Prompt:** A close-up shot of a hand gently holding a single sheet of aged, slightly textured paper. A meticulously cut-out silhouette of a mythical, dragon-like creature, rendered in a traditional East Asian ink wash style, is perfectly aligned with the architectural details of an ancient temple. Through the cutout, the intricate wooden eaves and weathered stone steps of the temple are visible, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a pre-dawn sky. Hints of lingering mist swirl around the base of the temple. The paper itself has a subtle, almost ethereal glow, as if the creature is about to leap out. The perspective is slightly low, emphasizing the grandeur of the temple.
- **Artistic Direction:** 强调历史感、神秘感和东方美学。纸张的选择和“墨洗风格”的剪影提升了艺术性，将剪影不再仅仅视为平面的轮廓，而是艺术风格的体现。

**2. 标题：未来都市：机械之心与黄昏天际线**

- **Prompt:** A sleek, gloved hand (perhaps cybernetic or futuristic) holds a piece of iridescent, semi-transparent plastic film. Embedded within the film is a sharply defined laser-cut silhouette of an intricate, steampunk-inspired mechanical gear or a stylized circuit board. Through the cutout, a sprawling cyberpunk city skyline unfolds at dusk, characterized by neon lights, towering skyscrapers, and aerial vehicles tracing glowing paths against a deep indigo sky. The light from the city filters through the plastic, creating subtle chromatic aberrations around the edges of the cutout, suggesting a digital interface. A single, distinct, glowing window in a distant building aligns perfectly with a key detail of the mechanical silhouette.
- **Artistic Direction:** 创造科幻感和未来感。材质（虹彩塑料）、剪影内容（机械/电路板）与背景（赛博朋克城市）的结合，以及“色差”的细节，都增强了技术与艺术的融合。

**3. 标题：自然低语：森林深处精灵的剪影世界**

- **Prompt:** A delicate hand, adorned with subtle, vine-like patterns, holds a piece of rough, organic bark paper. Etched into the paper is a gracefully flowing silhouette of a sylvan sprite or forest spirit, with ethereal, leaf-like wings. Through the cutout, a dense, sun-dappled ancient forest is revealed, with shafts of light piercing through the canopy onto a mossy forest floor. Tiny, luminous specs – perhaps enchanted fireflies or magical dust – float within the cutout space, appearing to emanate from the forest itself. The background soundscape implies rustling leaves and distant bird calls. The hand seamlessly blends with the natural environment.
- **Artistic Direction:** 强调自然、奇幻和唯美。纸张材质选择（树皮纸）和剪影内容（精灵）与森林背景完美契合，发光的细节增加了魔幻氛围。

**4. 标题：古典诗篇：月下古筝与山水意境**

- **Prompt:** An elegant, slender hand, perhaps in traditional Chinese attire, delicately holds a fan-shaped piece of antique rice paper. A beautifully rendered, flowing silhouette of a musician playing a guqin (Chinese zither) is cut into the paper. Through the cutout, a serene, ink-wash style landscape unfolds: a lone, gnarled pine tree clinging to a cliff face, a misty mountain range in the distance, and a full, luminous moon hanging in the sky. The light of the moon seems to cast a subtle, silver glow onto the edges of the rice paper cutout. Swirling, almost invisible lines of "music" or "poetry" emanate from the guqin silhouette into the moonlit scene.
- **Artistic Direction:** 聚焦于古典、诗意和东方艺术。扇形纸张、古筝剪影与水墨山水背景的结合，以及“音乐/诗歌线条”的意象，营造出一种超脱的艺术境界。

**5. 标题：碎裂的现实：城市之魂的抽象剪影**

- **Prompt:** A roughly calloused hand, suggesting urban grit, holds a torn, asymmetrical piece of corrugated cardboard. The cutout is not a defined figure, but an abstract, fragmented shape – like a broken window pane or a jagged crack – through which a bustling, gritty city street is visible at street level. Rain streaks down the visible street, blurring car lights into impressionistic smudges. Faint, ghostly outlines of passing pedestrians or reflections can be glimpsed within the cutout. The raw edge of the cardboard contrasts sharply with the fleeting, impressionistic view of the city. The overall mood is melancholic yet visually striking.
- **Artistic Direction:** 探索抽象、现实主义和情感深度。纸张材质（瓦楞纸板）、非具象剪影与日常城市背景的结合，创造出一种粗粝而富有表现力的艺术效果。

- **标题：暗影箴言：黑曜石映照的霓虹都市夜阑**
- **Prompt:** A sleek, almost minimalist hand, perhaps with black-painted nails or metallic accents, firmly grips a polished piece of **frosted obsidian**. The stone is intensely dark, almost non-reflective, giving it a heavy, grounding presence, though its frosted surface diffuses any stray light into subtle halos. A jagged, almost aggressive silhouette of a **modern skyscraper skyline, an abstract representation of crashing waves in a storm, or a lone, angular street lamp** is precisely carved into the obsidian, creating a stark, high-contrast opening. Through this sharp, dark void, a **vibrant, high-energy metropolis at its peak of activity at night** is seen: blurred streaks of red and white from car lights, glowing neon signs in bold primary colors, illuminated windows forming grids on towering buildings, and a sense of bustling, almost overwhelming urban life, set against a dark, inky sky. The obsidian's dark nature makes the vibrant city lights pop with extreme intensity.
- **Artistic Direction:** 强调对比、现代感、都市的活力与疏离。黑曜石的深邃与都市的霓虹灯火形成强烈反差，既展现都市的魅力，又暗示其冷峻的一面。

**3. 材质：古老泛黄的羊皮卷 (Aged Parchment Scroll)**

- **标题：历史回声：羊皮卷窥见的幽光旧影古城**
- **Prompt:** An aged, perhaps slightly trembling hand, with visible veins and wrinkles, delicately unrolls and holds a fragment of **ancient, brittle, and yellowed parchment scroll**. The parchment is marked with faded, illegible script, and its edges are frayed and torn, suggesting centuries of existence. A subtly intricate, almost calligraphic silhouette of a **medieval castle turret, an ancient Roman aqueduct lit by moonlight, or the outline of an old sailing ship** is carefully cut or naturally worn into the parchment. Through this historical aperture, a **softly illuminated, ethereal ancient city or historical landmark at a moonlit night** is revealed: crumbling stone walls, flickering torchlights in the distance, a misty river glinting under a pale moon, and the silent, haunting presence of history, rendered in muted, sepia tones with a focus on texture and atmosphere rather than harsh clarity.
- **Artistic Direction:** 营造历史感、怀旧、神秘和静谧的氛围。羊皮卷的古老与残缺，与月光下的古城遗迹相得益彰，唤起对逝去岁月的遐想。

**4. 材质：冰块/冰雕 (Ice Block / Ice Sculpture)**

- **标题：凛冬之境：冰晶棱镜中的极光幻舞**
- **Prompt:** A gloved hand, its knuckles faintly reddened by the cold, carefully holds a perfectly clear, **smooth block of ice, or a fragment of an elaborately carved ice sculpture**. The ice refracts and subtly distorts light, and there might be tiny, captured air bubbles within its crystalline structure. A sharp, almost transparent silhouette of a **polar bear's profile, a soaring arctic bird, or the jagged peaks of an icy mountain range** is precisely carved into the ice, creating a prism-like opening. Through this icy window, a spectacular **Arctic night sky, alive with the vibrant, dancing curtains of the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)**, is seen: swirling ribbons of green, pink, and purple light illuminating a vast, pristine frozen landscape of snow and ice, with distant, stark mountains under a moonless, star-dusted sky. The ice itself seems to shimmer with complementary colors.
- **Artistic Direction:** 强调纯净、寒冷、壮丽和自然奇观。冰的透明与折射特性，与极光的神秘与美丽完美结合，创造出令人惊叹的场景。

**5. 材质：玻璃灯笼/彩色玻璃烛台 (Glass Lantern / Stained Glass Candelabra Fragment)**

- **标题：光影物语：彩光玻璃罩中的雨夜迷城**
- **Prompt:** A warm hand, gently cradles a fragment of a colorful, patterned glass lantern (like Moroccan or Tiffany style) . The glass pieces are joined by dark lead lines, and the overall effect is one of contained, diffused light, casting soft, colored patterns. A whimsical, almost storybook-like silhouette of a cozy house with a smoking chimney, a lone figure walking with an umbrella, uncolored glass section. Through this warm, illuminated opening, a rainy, misty city street at night is depicted: wet cobblestones reflecting blurred streetlights, glowing windows in distant buildings, shimmering puddles, and the soft, diffused light of cars passing by, creating a nostalgic and slightly melancholic atmosphere. The colored glass frames the scene like a portal to a comforting, yet distant, world.
- **Artistic Direction:** 营造温馨、浪漫、神秘和一丝忧郁的氛围。彩色玻璃的柔和光线与雨夜的城市景观相映成趣，创造出富有故事感的画面。
