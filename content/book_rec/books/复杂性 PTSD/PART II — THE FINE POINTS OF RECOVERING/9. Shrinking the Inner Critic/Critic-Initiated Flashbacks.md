**Critic-initiated Flashbacks  
  
由批评者引发的闪回**

The inner critic commonly increases the intensity of a flashback via a barrage of the attacks listed above. Flashbacks can devolve into increasingly painful levels of the abandonment depression. One attack can repetitively bleed into another and tumble us further down a spiral of hopelessness. It is awful enough to take a single punch in a fight, but when the punches keep coming, the victim is severely thrashed.  
  
内在的批评者通常通过上述攻击的连珠炮来增加闪回的强度。闪回可能会恶化成越来越痛苦的被遗弃抑郁症水平。一次攻击可能会反复渗透到另一次攻击中，并将我们进一步推入绝望的螺旋。在战斗中挨一拳已经够糟糕的了，但当拳头不断袭来时，受害者会受到严重的打击。

Once again, Cptsd flashbacks do not typically have a visual component. However, it is not unusual for a survivor to sometimes flash on a snapshot of a parent’s contemptuous face at the moment of triggering.  
  
再次强调，PTSD 的闪回通常没有视觉成分。然而，幸存者在触发时偶尔会闪现一张父母蔑视的面孔的照片，这并不罕见。

My client, Dmitri, began his session by telling me that he was contentedly puttering around his kitchen when he accidentally knocked over a glass of water. He immediately pictured his father and a loud internal voice blurted: “I’m such a world class spaz!”  
  
我的客户 Dmitri 开始他的疗程时告诉我，他正心满意足地在厨房里忙来忙去，不小心碰倒了杯水。他立刻想到了他的父亲，一个响亮的声音脱口而出：“我真是世界上最笨拙的人！”

Retrospectively, he realized that he then plummeted instantly into a flashback. Anxiety quickly overwhelmed him and he was soon lost in a tirade of self-attacking diatribes emanating from the critic. “Spaz” is an example of the name-calling that the critic specializes in. It is a combination of critic attacks # 1, 3 and 9 above.  
  
回顾起来，他意识到当时他立刻陷入了闪回。焦虑很快压倒了他，他很快陷入了来自批评者的自我攻击的狂潮。“笨拙”是批评者擅长的一种侮辱性称呼。它是上面提到的批评攻击 1、3 和 9 的组合。

The attacks soon deteriorated into a full scale laundry listing of all his imperfections. These were characteristically blown out of proportion, and often not reality based. The critic screamed: “I’m so clumsy. I never do anything right \[#2 all-or-none thinking\]. “I could f\*ck up a free lunch!”  
  
攻击很快演变成了一长串列举他所有缺点。这些缺点通常被夸大，而且往往不是基于现实。批评者尖叫道：“我真是太笨拙了。我从来做不好任何事情\[2 号全或无思维\]。“我连免费的午餐都能搞砸！”

Quickly, Dmitri’s thinking was totally dominated by a negative focus\[#11\] that merged with drasticizing \[#10\], and culminated in attack fantasies \[#14\] that made him cancel his plans to go out.  
  
迅速地，德米特的思维完全被一种消极的关注所占据\[11\]，这种关注与夸大其词\[10\]相结合，最终演变成攻击幻想\[14\]，使他取消了外出计划。

[[null|]]This example is only a micro-portion of the unending onslaught that can accompany a major flashback. After enduring many, many more elaborations of this process, Dmitri became entrenched in the ultimate abandonment catastrophization \[#10\]: “No wonder I don’t have a partner or any friends; who could tolerate being around such a loser” \[#2: He actually had two good friends\].  
  
这个例子只是伴随重大闪回可能出现的无休止的攻击中微不足道的一部分。在经历了许多更多关于这一过程的详细描述之后，德米特陷入了最终的放弃灾难化\[10\]：“难怪我没有伴侣或朋友；谁会忍受和这样一个失败者在一起” \[2：他实际上有两个好朋友\]。

Dmitri’s felt-sense of abandonment then morphed into self-abandonment. Primitive self-soothing behaviors reemerged as he self-medicated by binging on an enormous amount of junk food. He then retreated into his bedroom to dissociate further into a long morning nap.  
  
德米特对被遗弃的感觉随后转变为自我遗弃。原始的自我安抚行为再次出现，他通过暴饮暴食大量的垃圾食品来自我治疗。然后他退回到卧室，进一步通过长时间的午睡来脱离现实。

_All this_ in reaction to the tiny faux pas of a spilled glass of water!  
  
所有这一切都是对一杯洒出的水的微小小错误做出的反应！

I must emphasize here that Dmitri was not crazy or defective because his critic made a hell out of a spilled glass of water. _All this_ was a re-visit via flashback to the real traumatic experiences of being profoundly rejected by his parents for trivial mistakes. His father had contemptuously told him he could f\*ck up a free lunch innumerable times.  
  
我必须强调，德米特里并不是因为他的批评者把一杯洒出的水弄得一团糟就疯了或者有缺陷。所有这一切都是通过闪回重新回顾他因为一些微不足道的错误而被父母深深拒绝的真实创伤经历。他的父亲曾轻蔑地告诉他，他可以把免费的午餐搞砸无数次。

As Dmitri resolved and harvested the learning potential of this flashback, he said to me: “Pete, I can’t tell you how horrible they were. Life at home was one no-win, mind-f\*ck situation after another. F\*cked if I did, and f\*cked if I didn’t. It’s no wonder I’ve been stuck all these years with this ball and chain code: ‘Don’t ever let down your guard!’ Something’s just moved in me and I swear I’m gonna start cutting myself some slack!”  
  
当德米特里解决了并收获了这次闪回的学习潜力时，他对我说：“皮特，我无法告诉你它们有多么可怕。在家里的生活是一连串的输不起、精神折磨的情况。做了也糟糕，不做也糟糕。难怪我这些年一直带着这个沉重的锁链代码：‘永远不要放松警惕！’我内心有什么东西在移动，我发誓我要开始给自己一些宽容！”
