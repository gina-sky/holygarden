\*\*Perfectionism And Emotional Neglect

完美主义和情感忽视\*\*

As stated earlier, perfectionism also seems to be an instinctual defense for emotionally abandoned children. The existential impossibility of perfection saves the child from giving up, unless or until lack of success forces her to retreat into a dissociative freeze response or an anti-social fight response.

如前所述，完美主义似乎也是情感忽视的孩子的本能防御机制。完美主义的本体论上的不可能性使孩子免于放弃，除非或直到缺乏成功迫使她退缩到一种解离性冻结反应或反社会的战斗反应。

Perfectionism also provides a sense of meaning and direction for the powerless and unsupported child. Striving to be perfect offers her a semblance of a sense of control. Self-control is also safer to pursue because abandoning parents typically reserve their severest punishment for children who are vocal about their negligence.

完美主义也为无力和得不到支持的孩子提供了一种意义和方向。努力追求完美给她带来了一种控制感。自我控制也更为安全，因为父母通常将最严厉的惩罚保留给那些大声抱怨他们疏忽的孩子。

As the quest for perfection fails over and over, and as parental acceptance and nurturing remain elusive, imperfection becomes synonymous with shame and fear. Perceived imperfection triggers fear of abandonment, which triggers self-hate for imperfection, which expands abandonment into self-abandonment. This in turn amps fear up even further, which in turn intensifies self-disgust, etc. On and on it goes in a downward spiral of fear and shame-encrusted [[null|]]depression. It can go on for hours, days, weeks, and for those with severe Cptsd, can become their standard mode of being.

随着对完美的追求一次又一次地失败，以及父母的接受和养育仍然遥不可及，不完美变得与羞耻和恐惧同义。感知到的不完美会引发被遗弃的恐惧，这会引发对不完美的自我厌恶，这会将遗弃扩展到自我遗弃。这反过来进一步加剧了恐惧，进而加剧了自我厌恶，等等。它可能持续数小时、数天、数周，对于那些患有严重 Cptsd 的人来说，这可能会成为他们的标准生存模式。
