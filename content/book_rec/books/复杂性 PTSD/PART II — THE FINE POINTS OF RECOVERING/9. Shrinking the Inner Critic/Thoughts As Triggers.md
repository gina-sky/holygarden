\*\*Thoughts As Triggers

触发思考\*\*

Rejecting parents typically make the child believe that his opinions and feelings are dangerous imperfections. In worst case scenarios the mere impulse to speak triggers fear and shame. How could anything the child says not reveal his stupidity and worthlessness? Opening his mouth invariably leads to deeper rejection and trouble.

被父母拒绝通常会让孩子认为自己的观点和感情是危险的缺陷。在最糟糕的情况下，仅仅是说话的冲动就会引发恐惧和羞愧。孩子说的话怎么可能不暴露他的愚蠢和无价值？张嘴说话不可避免地会导致更深的拒绝和麻烦。

[[null|]]As ongoing neglect and abuse repetitively strengthen the critic, even the most innocuous, self-interested thought or musing can trigger a five alarm fire of intense emotional flashback. To maintain the illusive hope of someday winning parental approval, the child’s perfectionistic striving escalates, and may become obsessive/compulsive. Even an imagined mistake can then initiate a flashback.

随着持续的忽视和虐待反复强化批评者，即使是再无害、自私的想法或沉思也可能引发一场强烈的情感回忆风暴。为了维持那虚幻的希望，有一天能赢得父母的认可，孩子的完美主义追求升级，可能变得强迫性/强迫症。甚至一个想象中的错误也可能引发回忆。
