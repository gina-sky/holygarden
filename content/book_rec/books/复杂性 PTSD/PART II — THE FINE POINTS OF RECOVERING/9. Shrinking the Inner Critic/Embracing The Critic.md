\*\*Embracing The Critic

拥抱批评者\*\*

In my experience, until the fight response is substantially restored, the Cptsd client benefits little from CBT, psychodynamic or mindfulness techniques that encourage us to accept the critic. In later recovery, when the survivor has removed the venomous stinger from the critic, these techniques can be quite valuable. Then, and only then, are we able to reconnect with the helpful side of healthy self-criticism \[see Stone and Stone’s book _Embracing Your Inner Critic_\].

在我的经验中，直到战斗反应得到显著恢复，Cptsd 患者从认知行为疗法、心理动力学或正念技巧中获益甚微，这些技巧鼓励我们接受批评。在后续的康复过程中，当幸存者从批评者那里移除毒刺后，这些技巧可以非常有价值。那时，也只有那时，我们才能重新与健康的自我批评的有益一面建立联系\[参见 Stone 和 Stone 的著作《拥抱你的内心批评》\]。

A typical indication that the critic has mellowed into being functional is that it speaks to us in a kind and helpful voice. It reminds us dispassionately to adjust our behavior when we can and ought to be doing something better. If, however, it blasts us for imperfection, it is giving itself away as the toxic critic that was installed by our parents.

一个典型的迹象是，评论家已经变得实用，那就是它用温和而有益的声音对我们说话。它冷静地提醒我们在能够并且应该做得更好的时候调整我们的行为。然而，如果它因为我们的不完美而猛烈抨击我们，那么它就暴露了自己是我们父母安装的有毒评论家。

A left-brained, objective approach of embracing the critic is rarely helpful unless it is balanced with a subjective, right-brained capacity for assertive self-protection. Perhaps this is because the inner critic appears to operate simultaneously with hyper-emotional right-brain flashback dynamics. Perhaps toxic inner critic processes are so emotionally overwhelming that efforts to resist them rationally and dispassionately are too weak to be effective.

左脑的客观方法去接受批评通常很少有帮助，除非它与主观的、右脑的积极自我保护能力相平衡。或许这是因为内在的批评者似乎与超情绪化的右脑闪回动态同时运作。或许有毒的内在批评过程情感上过于压倒性，以至于理性且冷静地抵制它们的努力太弱，无法有效。
