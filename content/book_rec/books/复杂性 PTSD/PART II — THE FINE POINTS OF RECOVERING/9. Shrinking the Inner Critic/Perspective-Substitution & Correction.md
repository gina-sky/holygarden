\*\*Perspective-Substitution And Correction

视角替代与纠正\*\*

The most important thought correction of all is a switch in the perspective of our thinking.

所有思维纠正中最重要的是改变我们的思考视角。

_Perspective-substitution_ is a broadening of our overall perspective. It moves our viewpoint from the critic’s narrow, negative focus to the more balanced and accurate focus of the observing ego – the mindful self.

视角替代是扩大我们的整体视角。它将我们的观点从批评者的狭隘、消极关注转移到观察自我——有意识的自我——更加平衡和准确的关注。

Perspective-substitution helps us to dethrone the critic from its life-negating point of view. This resembles the firing of a bad manager or inept coach – one with a distorted view who dwells so much on what is wrong that he cannot see anything that is right.

视角替代帮助我们摆脱了批评家那否定生活的观点。这就像解雇一个糟糕的经理或不称职的教练——一个有扭曲观点的人，他过于关注错误之处，以至于看不到任何正确之处。

[[null|]]As stated in [[1. The Journey of Recovering From Cptsd|chapter 1]], perspective-substitution can be enhanced with the spiritual practice of gratitude. In this vein, gratitude is a type of mindfulness that looks for empirical proof that life is essentially good even though it is also quite difficult at times.

正如第一章所述，视角替代可以通过感恩的灵性实践来加强。在这方面，感恩是一种正念，它寻找经验证据来证明生活本质上是好的，尽管有时也相当困难。
