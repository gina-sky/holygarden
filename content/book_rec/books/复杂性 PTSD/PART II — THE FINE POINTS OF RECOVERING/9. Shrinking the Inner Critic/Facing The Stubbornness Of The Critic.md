\*\*Facing The Stubbornness Of The Critic

面对批评者的顽固\*\*

The work of shrinking the critic is one of the most essential processes of recovery. As obvious as its value may seem as you read this, embracing the task of renouncing the critic is much more challenging than it may seem at first blush.

缩小批评者的工作是最重要的恢复过程之一。尽管在阅读这段文字时，其价值可能显得显而易见，但接受放弃批评者的任务要比最初看起来更具挑战性。

The critic’s programs are not only burned deeply into our psyches by our parents, but we also unknowingly emblazon them into our minds by mimicking our parents. We are now the key reinforcing agents of their toxic legacy. With little mindfulness of it, we injure ourselves with countless angry, self-disgusted repetitions of their judgments. Recovery now depends on you withdrawing your blind allegiance to this terrible process of only noticing yourself negatively.

批评者的程序不仅被我们的父母深深烙印在我们的心理中，我们还不知不觉地通过模仿父母将它们刻印在我们的脑海中。我们现在成为了他们有毒遗产的关键强化者。我们对这一点缺乏意识，用无数愤怒、自我厌恶的重复他们的判断来伤害自己。现在的恢复取决于你撤回对这种只关注自己负面方面的可怕过程的盲目忠诚。

The task of diminishing these self-negating patterns is daunting. It is typically lifetime work – often negotiable only at the rate of [[null|]]two-steps-forward, one-step backward. And oh how unfair it is that the step backward often feels more like six!

减少这些自我否定的模式是一项艰巨的任务。这通常是终身的工作——往往只能以两步前进、一步后退的速度进行。而且哦，多么不公平啊，那一步后退常常感觉像是六步！

Yet recent findings in neuroscience \[_The General Theory of Love; The Talking Cure_\] have shown that biologically ingrained mental patterns can be diminished and replaced with new ones through long term repetitive work. I believe this is analogous to adding or subtracting girth to parts of your physique, which typically takes seemingly innumerable repetitions of a given exercise.

然而，最近神经科学的研究\[《爱的整体理论》；《谈话治疗》\]表明，通过长期重复的工作，可以减少生物固有的心理模式，并用新的模式来替代。我相信这与增加或减少你身体某部位的围度类似，这通常需要看似无数次的特定运动重复。

In the last couple of decades my brain has gone from being my own worst enemy almost all the time to being very reliably on my side. I have also seen similar gains with many of the clients I have worked with long-term.

在过去的几十年里，我的大脑已经从几乎一直是我最大的敌人变成了非常可靠的支持者。我也看到了与我长期合作的许多客户取得了类似的进步。
