更多关于危险的内容**

The importance and magnitude of the critic’s endangerment programs cannot be overstated. I have worked with numerous “well-therapized” people who were relatively free from perfectionism, but still seriously afflicted with the critic’s addiction to noticing potential danger. Said another way, I have seen survivors eliminate much of their perfectionist, self-attacking thinking without realizing that the critic was still flooding their minds with fear-inducing thoughts and images.  
  
批评家危险化项目的重性和重要性不容小觑。我曾与许多“接受过良好治疗”的人合作，他们相对摆脱了完美主义，但仍然严重沉迷于注意到潜在危险的批评家的习惯。换句话说，我曾看到幸存者消除了他们大部分的完美主义和自我攻击性思维，而没有意识到批评家仍在他们的脑海中灌输恐惧性的思想和图像。

I learned to disidentify from perfectionism long before I learned to stop perseverating on my critic’s harrowing snapshots of danger. In fact, I became quite adept at morphing these snapshots into feature long films about my imminent demise.  
  
在我学会停止对我的批评家那令人毛骨悚然的危险快照念念不忘之前，我就学会了与完美主义脱钩。事实上，我变得非常擅长将这些快照转变为关于我即将到来的死亡的长篇电影。

Permanent abandonment, public humiliation, lethal illness, lonely death, imminent attack, and penniless homelessness are common endangerment themes of many survivors. One of my clients identified his inner critic endangerment process as: “My critic, the horror movie producer”. This made me think: “My critic the terrorist”.  
  
永久放弃、公开羞辱、致命疾病、孤独死亡、即将到来的攻击和一贫如洗的流离失所是许多幸存者的常见危险主题。我的一个客户将他的内心批评家危险化过程描述为：“我的批评家，恐怖电影制片人”。这让我想到：“我的批评家，恐怖分子”。

If I had to describe the two most key processes of the critic, I would say this. First, the critic is above all a self-perpetuating process of extreme negative noticing. Second the critic is a constant hypervigilance that sees disaster hovering in the next moment about to launch into a full-court-press.  
  
如果我必须描述批评家最重要的两个过程，我会这样说。首先，批评家首先是一个极端负面注意力的自我延续过程。其次，批评家是一种持续的过度警觉，它看到灾难在下一刻徘徊，即将全面展开。
