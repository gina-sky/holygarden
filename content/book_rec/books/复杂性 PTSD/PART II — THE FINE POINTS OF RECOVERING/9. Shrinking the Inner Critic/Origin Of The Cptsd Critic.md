\*\*ORIGIN OF THE CPTSD CRITIC

CPTSD 批评者的起源\*\*

A flashback-inducing critic is typically spawned in a danger-ridden childhood home. This is true whether the danger comes from the passive abandonment of neglect or the active abandonment of abuse. When parents do not provide safe enough bonding and positive feedback, the child flounders in anxiety and fear. Many children appear to be hard-wired to adapt to this _endangering_ abandonment with perfectionism.

引发闪回的批评者通常在充满危险的家庭环境中产生。无论是来自忽视的被动遗弃还是虐待的主动遗弃，都是如此。当父母无法提供足够的安全感、亲密关系和积极的反馈时，孩子就会在焦虑和恐惧中挣扎。许多孩子似乎天生就注定要适应这种危险的遗弃，并以完美主义来应对。

A prevailing climate of danger forces the child’s superego to over-cultivate the various programs of perfectionism and endangerment listed below. Once again, the superego is the part of the psyche that learns parental rules in order to gain their acceptance.

一种普遍的危险氛围迫使孩子的超我过度培养以下各种完美主义和危险计划。再次强调，超我是心理中学习父母规则以获得他们接受的那部分。

[[null|]]The inner critic is the superego gone bad. The inner critic is the superego in overdrive desperately trying to win your parents’ approval. When perfectionist striving fails to win welcoming from your parents, the inner critic becomes increasingly hostile and caustic. It festers into a virulent inner voice that increasingly manifests self-hate, self-disgust and self-abandonment. The inner critic blames you incessantly for shortcomings that it imagines to be the cause of your parents’ rejection. It is incapable of understanding that the real cause lies in your parents’ shortcomings.

内在批评者是变质的超我。内在批评者是超我过度运作，拼命试图赢得父母的认可。当完美主义的努力未能赢得父母的欢迎时，内在批评者变得越来越敌对和刻薄。它变成了一种恶性的内在声音，越来越表现出自我仇恨、自我厌恶和自我放弃。内在批评者不断地责备你，认为你想象中的缺点是父母拒绝的原因。它无法理解真正的原因在于父母的缺点。

As a traumatized child, your over-aroused sympathetic nervous system also drives you to become increasingly hypervigilant. H*ypervigilance* is a fixation on looking for danger that comes from excessive exposure to real danger. In an effort to recognize, predict and avoid danger, hypervigilance is ingrained in your approach to being in the world. Hypervigilance narrows your attention into an incessant, on-guard scanning of the people around you. It also frequently projects you into the future, imagining danger in upcoming social events. Moreover, hypervigilance typically devolves into intense performance anxiety on every level of self-expression.

作为一个受过创伤的孩子，你过度活跃的交感神经系统也驱使你变得越来越警觉。过度警觉是对寻找危险的执着，这种危险来自于对真实危险的过度暴露。为了识别、预测和避免危险，过度警觉已经深深植根于你与世界相处的方式中。过度警觉使你的注意力变得狭窄，陷入对周围人的持续、警惕的扫描。它还经常让你陷入未来，想象即将到来的社交活动中的危险。此外，过度警觉通常会导致在自我表达的每个层面上都出现强烈的表演焦虑。

Like the soldier overlong in combat, ptsd sets in because you feel as if you are constantly under attack. Unfortunately, internal attack is now added to external attack, and you become locked into hypervigilance and sympathetic nervous system arousal.

就像在战斗中久经沙场的士兵一样，由于你感觉自己始终处于攻击之下，PTSD 就产生了。不幸的是，现在内部攻击被添加到外部攻击中，你陷入了过度警觉和交感神经系统的觉醒。

A traumatized child becomes desperate to relieve the anxiety and depression of abandonment. The critic-driven child can only think about the ways she is too much or not enough. The child’s unfolding sense of self \[the healthy ego\], finds no room to develop. Her identity virtually becomes the critic. The superego trumps the ego.

一个受创伤的孩子渴望缓解被遗弃的焦虑和抑郁。受批评驱动的孩子只能想到自己太多或不够。孩子正在展开的自我意识（健康的自我），找不到发展的空间。她的身份几乎变成了批评者。超我战胜了自我。

In this process, the critic becomes increasingly virulent and eventually switches from the parents’ internalized voice: “You’re [[null|]]a bad boy/girl” to the first person: “I’m a bad boy/girl.” Over time, self-goading increasingly deteriorates: “_I’m_ such a loser. _I’m_ so pathetic… bad... ugly…worthless…stupid...defective.”

在这个过程中，批评者变得越来越恶毒，最终从父母内化的声音：“你是个坏男孩/女孩”转变为第一人称：“我是个坏男孩/女孩。”随着时间的推移，自我鞭策越来越恶化：“我是个失败者。我如此可怜……坏……丑陋……毫无价值……愚蠢……有缺陷。”

This is unlike the soldier in combat who does not develop a toxic critic. This process whereby the superego becomes carcinogenic is a key juncture where ptsd morphs into Cptsd. The cruel, totalitarian inner critic is a key distinguishing feature of Cptsd.

这与在战斗中不发展成有毒批评的士兵不同。这个过程，即超我变得致癌，是 ptsd 转变为 Cptsd 的关键节点。残酷的、极权主义的内在批评是 Cptsd 的一个关键特征。

One of my clients grief-fully remembered the constant refrains of his childhood: “If only I wasn’t so needy and selfish…if only my freckles would fade...if only I could pitch a perfect game...if only I could stop gagging on the canned peas during dinner...if only I could pray all the time to get mom’s arthritis cured, then maybe she’d stop picking on me, and then maybe dad would play catch with me.”

我的一个客户悲伤地回忆起他童年时的不断重复：“要是我不那么贪婪和自私就好了……要是我脸上的雀斑能消失……要是我能投出完美的球……要是我能在晚餐时停止对罐头豌豆的反感……要是我能一直祈祷妈妈的关节炎能治愈，那么她可能就不会再挑剔我，然后爸爸可能会和我玩接球。”

In my work with survivors, I am continuously struck by how often the inner critic triggers them into overwhelming emotional flashbacks. The Cptsd-derived inner critic weds our fear of abandonment to our self-hate about our imperfections. It then tortures us with the entwined serpents of perfectionism and endangerment. _Endangerment_ is the process of constantly projecting danger onto safe enough situations.

在我与幸存者一起工作的过程中，我不断被这种内在批评如何频繁地触发他们陷入强烈的情感闪回所震惊。创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）衍生出的内在批评将我们对被遗弃的恐惧与我们对自身不完美的自我厌恶结合在一起。然后，它用完美主义和危险交织的蛇来折磨我们。危险是将危险不断投射到足够安全的情况中的过程。

Your recovering depends on learning how to recognize and confront the 14 inner critic attacks listed below. When this process of recovering is bypassed, these deeply engrained programs continue to send you tumbling back into the overwhelming fear, shame and hopelessness of your childhood abandonment.

你的康复取决于学习如何识别和对抗以下列出的 14 种内在批评攻击。当这个过程被绕过时，这些深深植入的程序会继续让你陷入童年被遗弃时的强烈恐惧、羞愧和无助。
