**Shame Is Blame Unfairly Turned Against The Self  
  
羞愧是不公平地转向自己的责备**

The great psychologist, Erik Eriksen, gave us a great tool when he formulated this emotional mathematics equation. “Shame is blame turned against the self”. Our parents were too big and powerful to blame, so we had to blame ourselves instead. Now, however we are free of them, and we can cut off the critic’s shame supply by redirecting unfair self-blame back to our parents.  
  
伟大的心理学家埃里克·埃里克森在提出这个情感数学方程式时，给了我们一个很好的工具。“羞愧是责备转向自己”。我们的父母太大太强大，无法责备，所以我们不得不责备自己。现在，我们自由了，我们可以通过将不公平的自我责备重新指向我们的父母来切断批评者的羞愧供应。

You can redirect the anger of the critic’s blaming messages away from you. You can direct the anger onto the installers of the critic, or sideways onto the critic itself. You can give shame back by allowing yourself to feel angry and disgusted at the image of your parent bullying you. You can rage at them for overwhelming you with shame when you were too young and small to defend yourself.  
  
你可以将批评者责备信息的愤怒转向你。你可以将愤怒指向批评者的安装者，或者横向指向批评者本身。你可以通过让自己对父母欺负你的形象感到愤怒和厌恶来还回羞愧。你可以对他们发火，因为你太小太弱，无法为自己辩护，他们却用羞愧压垮了你。

[[null|]]An inner critic that has dominated us since childhood, however, does not give up its rulership of the psyche easily. It stubbornly refuses to accept the updated information that adulthood now offers the possibility of increasing safety and healthy attachment. It is as if the critic has worn a flashback-inducing groove in the brain the size of the Grand Canyon. Now, any of the thinking patterns listed earlier can hair-trigger an amygdala-hijacking that dumps us into the abandonment mélange.  
  
内心那个自幼年起就统治着我们的批评家，却并不轻易放弃对心理的控制。它固执地拒绝接受成年后提供的安全感和健康依恋的可能性。就好像批评家在大脑中刻下了一条回想起来的沟壑，其大小堪比大峡谷。现在，任何之前列出的思维模式都可以瞬间引发杏仁核劫持，将我们投入被遗弃的混乱之中。

Progress in critic-shrinking is often infinitesimally slow and indiscernible at first. Our brains have become addicted to only noticing what is wrong and what is dangerous. And as with most addictions, breaking this deeply entrenched habit may require lifelong management.  
  
批评家缩小的进展往往极其缓慢，一开始几乎察觉不到。我们的头脑已经上瘾于只注意到什么是不对的和什么是有危险的。而且，就像大多数上瘾一样，打破这种根深蒂固的习惯可能需要终生的管理。

In early recovery work, we need to challenge the critic’s monocular negative focus over and over with all the ferocity we can muster. Eventually with practice we can find a part of ourselves that is mad about how grossly unfair our parents’ bullying and indifference was. We can find a part of us that is outraged that we were indoctrinated and inculcated into chronically abandoning and bullying ourselves. We can fume that this occurred when we were too young to protest or even know what was happening to us. We can gradually build our ability to say “No!” and “Shut up!” whenever we catch the critic attacking us.  
  
在早期康复工作中，我们需要一次又一次地用我们所能聚集的所有力量挑战批评者的单眼负面焦点。最终，通过练习，我们可以找到自己内心深处对父母粗暴和冷漠行为极度不公平感到愤怒的部分。我们可以找到自己内心深处对被洗脑和灌输长期自我放弃和自我欺凌感到愤怒的部分。我们可以对这种事情发生在我们太小，无法抗议甚至不知道发生了什么感到愤怒。我们可以逐渐建立起当我们捕捉到批评者攻击我们时说“不！”和“闭嘴！”的能力。

With enough healthy inner self-defense, the survivor gradually learns to reject her unconscious acceptance of self-abuse and self-abandonment. Her sense of healthy self-protection begins to emerge and over time grows into a fierce willingness to stop unfair criticism - internal or external.  
  
有了足够的健康内在自我防御，幸存者逐渐学会拒绝她对自我虐待和自我放弃的无意识接受。她的健康自我保护感开始出现，并随着时间的推移逐渐成长为一个坚决停止不公平批评的意愿——无论是内在的还是外在的。

Psychologically speaking, this is part of the process of working through repetition compulsion. Deconstructing repetition compulsion has both an internal and external dimension. On the internal dimension, we decrease the habit of repetitively perpetrating our parents’ abuse against ourselves by staunchly confronting the inner [[null|]]critic. This then allows us to become more mindful on the external dimension when others reenact our parents’ mistreatment. We can then confront them to stop, or banish them from our lives. With enough practice, we can repudiate our parents’ awful legacy of teaching us that love means numbly accepting abuse and neglect.  
  
从心理学的角度来看，这是处理重复强迫的过程的一部分。解构重复强迫既有内部维度也有外部维度。在内部维度上，我们通过坚定地面对内心的批评者，减少反复重复我们父母对我们施加的虐待的习惯。这样，我们就能在外部维度上更加警觉，当他人重演我们父母的虐待行为时。我们随后可以阻止他们，或将他们从我们的生活中驱逐出去。经过足够的练习，我们可以拒绝我们父母那可怕的遗产，即教导我们爱意味着麻木地接受虐待和忽视。
