\*\*The Critic As The Shaming Internalized Parents

批评者作为内化的羞辱性父母\*\*

Not infrequently, a client comes into a session and shamefully confesses something that sounds like this: “I called myself a f\*ckwit over and over last night. I must really be inherently messed up, because I know my mother never said that. As bad as she was, she never swore and I doubt she ever even heard that word.”

并不少见，一位客户走进咨询室，羞愧地承认了一些听起来像这样的事情：“我昨晚一遍又一遍地称自己为废物。我一定天生就有问题，因为我知道我妈妈从未说过那样的话。她虽然很坏，但她从不发誓，我怀疑她甚至从未听过那个词。”

The explanation for this is that the critic is essentially a process. It is an ever developing process that co-opts our creativity and funnels it into “new and improved” ways of imitating our parents’ disparagement.

解释是这样的，批评者本质上是一个过程。它是一个不断发展的过程，它利用我们的创造力和乐趣，将其引导到“新改进”的模仿父母贬低的方式。

Parental contempt is the key piece of the emotional abuse that creates toxic shame. Toxic shame is the emotional matrix of the abandonment depression. It is also the glue that keeps us stuck helplessly in flashbacks. As such, toxic shame is the affect or emotional tone of the inner critic. Shame besmirches us as it emotionally intensifies each of the 14 assaults described above.

父母的不屑是造成有毒羞耻感的情感虐待的关键部分。有毒羞耻感是遗弃抑郁症的情感基质。它也是让我们无助地陷入闪回的粘合剂。因此，有毒羞耻感是内心批评者的情感或情绪基调。羞耻感玷污了我们，随着它情感上加剧上述描述的 14 种攻击中的每一种。

In main stream psychology, shame is often described as a social emotion. Normal shame is a somewhat healthy, self-regulating emotional reaction that arises when someone witnesses us acting in an unfair, offensive, or hurtful way.

在主流心理学中，羞耻感通常被描述为一种社会情感。正常的羞耻感是一种相对健康的、自我调节的情感反应，当有人看到我们以不公平、冒犯或伤害的方式行事时，就会产生。

This is not the case with toxic shame however. Many Cptsd survivors in recovery soon realize that they do not need a witness to suddenly be catapulted into a shame attack.

然而，有毒羞耻感并非如此。许多创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）康复者很快意识到，他们不需要证人就能突然陷入羞耻攻击。

[[null|]]Or was he? There is an invisible social context to toxic shame attacks. Toxic shame is social because the inner critic came into existence through pathological interactions with our parents. Moreover, toxic shame is social in the moment of the solitary flashback, because at the time it is as if we are in the presence of our parents.

或者他是吗？有毒羞耻攻击有一个无形的社会背景。有毒羞耻是社会的，因为内在的批评家是通过与父母的病理性互动而产生的。此外，有毒羞耻在孤独的闪回时刻也是社会的，因为那时我们仿佛就在父母面前。

For me, the strongest evidence of this occurs when I am on my own and trying to do something difficult. If I make a mistake or do not accomplish my task as efficiently as possible, I often feel very anxious as if I am being watched and criticized.

对我来说，这一点的最强证据出现在我独自一人尝试做某件困难的事情时。如果我犯了一个错误，或者没有尽可能高效地完成任务，我常常会感到非常焦虑，仿佛有人在监视和批评我。

I believe this phenomenon corresponds with an internalization of our parents. Our parents were such formative and formidable presences in our developing life, that we have strong representations of them in our psyches. These representations include their beliefs and condemnation about us. Until we work on shrinking their influence, our internalized parents exist in our psyches as the key controlling force of our lives.

我相信这一现象与我们对父母的内化有关。我们的父母在我们成长的过程中是如此有形和强大的存在，以至于我们在心理上对他们有强烈的印象。这些印象包括他们对我们的信念和谴责。直到我们努力缩小他们的影响，我们内化的父母在我们心理上作为我们生活的关键控制力存在。
