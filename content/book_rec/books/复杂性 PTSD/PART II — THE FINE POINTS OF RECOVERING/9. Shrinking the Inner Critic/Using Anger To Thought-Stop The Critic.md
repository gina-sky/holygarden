**Using Anger To Thought-Stop The Critic  
  
利用愤怒来停止批评家的思维**

Thought-stopping is the process of using willpower to disidentify from and interrupt toxic thoughts and visualizations. Sometimes [[null|]]visualizing a stop sign at the same time can help strengthen thought-stopping.  
  
思维停止是通过意志力来识别并中断有毒思想和视觉化的过程。有时同时想象一个停车标志可以帮助加强思维停止。

Since traumatizing parents cripple the instinctive fight response of their child, recovering the anger of the fight response is essential in healing Cptsd. We need the aid of our fight response to empower the process of thought-stopping the critic.  
  
由于创伤性父母削弱了孩子本能的战斗反应，恢复战斗反应的愤怒对于治疗 Cptsd 至关重要。我们需要战斗反应的帮助来赋予停止批评家思维的过程力量。

I cannot over-encourage you to use your anger to stop the critic in its tracks. We can re-hijack the anger of the critic’s attack, and forcefully redirect it at the critic instead of ourselves. We can then silently and internally say “No!” or “Stop!” or “Shut Up!” to short-circuit drasticizing and perfectionistic mental processes.  
  
我无法过分鼓励你们利用愤怒来阻止批评者的攻击。我们可以重新夺回批评者攻击中的愤怒，并将其强有力地转向批评者而不是我们自己。然后我们可以默默地、内在地说“不！”或“停止！”或“闭嘴！”来打断极端化和完美主义的心理过程。

Angrily saying “No!” to the critic sets an internal boundary against unnatural, anti-self processes. It is the hammer of self-renovating carpentry that rebuilds our instinct of self-protection. Furthermore recovery is deepened by directing our anger at anyone who helped install the critic, as well as at anyone who is currently contributing to keeping it alive.  
  
愤怒地对批评者说“不！”为不自然、反自我过程设定了内部界限。它是自我修复木工的锤子，重建我们的自我保护本能。此外，通过将我们的愤怒指向任何帮助安装批评者的人，以及任何目前正帮助其存活的人，我们可以加深恢复过程。

I recently received this e-mail from a website respondent who read some of my writing about angering at the critic: “Another explanation I really liked is for people that don’t have much of the FIGHT response to start using it to stop the inner critic. I am a huge fan of self-compassion which has really helped me recently (loving-kindness) and I continually just accept all the messages and just let them flow by. When I heard your comments about saying NO and rejecting them, I was like ‘Yeah- I guess Pete maybe hasn’t found it all yet.’ I was being close minded. A couple days later I tried it out and Oh My Gog has it helped. I get mad now and it just shuts down my anxiety and turns shame into blame/anger. It feels much better for me! After all it wasn’t messages I would have given to myself, and they are all messages from my parents.”  
  
我最近收到了一位网站回复者发来的电子邮件，他阅读了我关于愤怒和批评者的文章：“我非常喜欢的一个解释是，对于那些几乎没有 FIGHT 反应的人来说，开始使用它来停止内心的批评。我是自我同情的大粉丝，这最近真的帮助了我（慈爱之心），我不断地接受所有信息，让它们流过。当我听到你关于说“不”和拒绝它们的评论时，我想‘是的，我想 Pete 可能还没有找到所有方法。’我太固执了。几天后我试了试，哦我的天哪，这真的有帮助。我现在会生气，它只是关闭了我的焦虑，将羞愧转化为责备/愤怒。这让我感觉好多了！毕竟，这些信息并不是我会给自己发的，它们都是来自我父母的信息。”

Successful critic-shrinking usually requires thousands of angry skirmishes with the critic. Passionate motivation for this work often arises when we construct an accurate picture of our upbringing. Natural anger eventually arises when we really get how little and defenseless we were when our parents bullied us into hating ourselves.  
  
成功的缩小批评者通常需要与批评者进行数千次愤怒的小冲突。当我们构建出一个准确的成长背景图时，对这项工作的热情动机往往会出现。当我们真正理解到，当父母强迫我们恨自己时，我们当时是多么的无助和脆弱，自然的愤怒最终会爆发。

Most trauma survivors were blank slates who were brainwashed into accepting the critic as their primary identity. To the degree that a family is Cptsd-engendering, to that degree is it like a mini-cult. Cults demand absolute loyalty to the leader’s authority and belief system. In early thought-stopping work, most survivors need to empower their efforts with a healthy rage against their parents for destroying their self-loyalty and their self-individuation. However, with enough practice, the survivor’s healthy observing ego can use willpower alone to disidentify from the critic.  
  
大多数创伤幸存者是一块块白板，被洗脑接受批评者作为他们主要的身份。一个家庭在培养 PTSD（创伤后应激障碍）方面有多严重，它就有多像一个小型邪教。邪教要求对领导者的权威和信仰体系绝对忠诚。在早期停止思考的工作中，大多数幸存者需要用对父母破坏他们的自我忠诚和自我个性的健康愤怒来增强他们的努力。然而，随着练习的深入，幸存者的健康观察自我可以仅凭意志力与批评者脱离认同。

My son’s birth graced me with an enormous boost in my motivation to practice thought-stopping on the critic. Witnessing the many miracles of his ongoing development moved me to increasingly deepen my emotional bonding with him. This was quite disconcerting to my critic which began working overtime on its endangerment programs.  
  
儿子的出生极大地增强了我练习停止思考批评者的动机。见证他持续发展的许多奇迹，让我越来越深入地与他建立情感联系。这让我的批评者感到非常不安，它开始加班工作，启动了它的危险计划。

The critic warned me interminably about the danger of my rapidly expanding attachment to him. It was trying to protect me from the devastation that would ensue if my loving emotional investment turned out as badly as it did with my parents. What if untrustworthy “Life” let him die or rendered him a “bad seed.”  
  
评论家无休止地警告我关于我对他的迅速扩张的依恋的危险。他试图保护我免受我爱的情感投资结果像我父母那样糟糕所带来的毁灭。如果不可信的“生活”让他死去，或者让他成为一个“坏种”，那会怎样？

The critic manufactured the most dreadful horror movies of accidents, diseases, kidnapping, mental illness, oedipal betrayals, [[null|]]etc. Had I not known how to recognize, interpret and refuse to indulge these catastrophizations, I am sure that my capacity to bond with him would have been seriously compromised. Moreover, had I not been able to use my outrage to disidentify from the critic, thought-stopping by itself would not have been a powerful enough tool.  
  
评论家制造了最可怕的关于事故、疾病、绑架、精神疾病、俄狄浦斯背叛等恐怖电影。如果我不知道如何识别、解释并拒绝沉溺于这些灾难化，我确信我与他建立联系的能力将会严重受损。此外，如果我不能利用我的愤怒来与评论家区分开来，仅仅通过停止思考本身就不会是一个足够强大的工具。

I particularly like this way of challenging the critic. “I’m not afraid of you anymore, mom and dad. You were the critic, and you put the critic in me. I renounce your toxic messages. Take back your shame and disgust. I am disgusted at your shameful job of parenting.”  
  
我特别喜欢这种挑战评论家的方式。“我不再害怕你们了，妈妈和爸爸。你们是评论家，你们在我心中种下了评论家。我拒绝你们的毒性信息。收回你们的羞耻和厌恶。我对你们羞耻的育儿方式感到厌恶。”

One of my clients shared with me a phrase that spontaneously came to her while she was fighting her critic at home. “You totally ruined my childhood, and I’m not going to let you get away with ruining my life now.” She reported that this perspective emblazoned in her consciousness, and now often helps to fire her up to fire the critic.  
  
我的一个客户告诉我，当她在家与自己的批评者斗争时，突然想到一句话。“你完全毁了我的童年，我不会让你现在毁了我的生活。”她表示，这个观点深深烙印在她的意识中，现在经常帮助她激发斗志去对抗批评者。
