**THOUGHT-SUBSTITUTION AND THOUGHT-CORRECTION  
  
思维替代和思维纠正**

Thought-substitution, especially in the form of thought-correction, is another essential tool for empowering the work of thought-stopping the critic. Many years ago, I sensed that my critic became as tough as a body-builder’s bicep through myriad repetitions. I guessed that similarly exercising self-protective responses to the critic would build my thought-correction muscles. It did in fact, and my instinct to protect myself almost always arises automatically now when I am triggered into a flashback. I believe I am not exaggerating when I say that tens of thousands of positive thought-substitutions have rewarded me with a psyche that is fairly consistently user-friendly.  
  
思维替代，尤其是以思维纠正的形式，是赋予停止批评工作以力量的另一个基本工具。许多年前，我感觉到我的批评者通过无数次的重复变得像健美运动员的二头肌一样坚韧。我猜测，类似地锻炼对批评者的自我保护反应将增强我的思维纠正肌肉。事实上，它确实做到了，现在当我被触发闪回时，我本能地保护自己的冲动几乎总是自动出现。当我说我因为数十万次积极的思维替代而得到了一个相当一致地友好心理时，我相信我没有夸张。

Accordingly, I encourage you to immediately confront the critic’s negative messages with positive ones like those in the list at the beginning of the chapter. This is essential in Cptsd recovery, because a single unconfronted toxic thought can act like a virus and rage infectiously out of control into a flu-like mélange of shame, fear and helplessness.  
  
因此，我鼓励你立即用正面的信息来对抗批评者的负面信息，就像章节开头列表中的那些。这在 PTSD 康复中至关重要，因为一个未被面对的有毒思想可以像病毒一样，传染性地失控地变成一种类似流感的混合体，包括羞愧、恐惧和无助。

Moving quickly into thought-stopping and thought correction often obviates a headlong tumble into the downward spiral of a flashback. This is essential in critic-work, as the critic typically attacks us more viciously once it has gotten up a head of steam. At such times, the critic can hypocritically scorn us for falling back into self-criticism when we “should” know better. This is the time then, more than ever, to “thought-correct and not self-berate,” as my last intern liked to say to her clients.  
  
迅速进行思维停止和思维纠正通常可以避免一头栽进闪回的下行螺旋。这在批评工作中至关重要，因为批评者一旦积累了一定的势头，通常会更加猛烈地攻击我们。在这样的时刻，批评者可能会虚伪地嘲笑我们，因为我们“应该”知道得更好，却仍然陷入自我批评。这时，正如我的最后一位实习生喜欢对她客户说的那样，“思维纠正，而不是自我谴责”。

Additionally, I encourage you to write out a list of your positive qualities and accomplishments to read it to yourself if you get lost in self-hate. [[Toolbox 5. Self-Gratitudes_ Gratitudes about Others|Toolbox 5]] in [[16. Self-Help Tools|chapter 16]] is a practical exercise to help you elaborate this list in a multidimensional way.  
  
此外，我鼓励你列出你自己的优点和成就，并在陷入自我仇恨时读给自己听。第 16 章的工具箱 5 是一个实际练习，帮助你以多维度的方式详细阐述这份清单。

Making a written record of your positive attributes is especially helpful as flashbacks often create a temporary amnesia about your [[null|]]essential worthiness and goodness. Flashbacks seem to involve a temporary loss of access to more current left-brain learning. MRI’s show greatly reduced left-brain activity in hyper-aroused Cptsd survivors. In my experience, memorizing your list enhances your capacity to dissolve that amnesia.  
  
将你的积极特质写成文字记录特别有帮助，因为闪回往往会暂时让你忘记你的基本价值和善良。闪回似乎涉及暂时失去访问更近期的左脑学习。MRI 显示，在高度激动的 Cptsd 幸存者中，左脑活动显著减少。在我的经验中，记住你的清单可以增强你消除这种健忘的能力。

Reciting part or all of your list over and over like a mantra can also help you during those times when the critic is particularly severe and relentless. If you have trouble making the list or filling out [[Toolbox 5. Self-Gratitudes_ Gratitudes about Others|Toolbox 5]], ask a friend or a therapist for their input. Additionally, please let me remind you that qualities do not have to be perfect or ever-present to qualify as qualities. If it is true of you most of the time then, it is a quality.  
  
反复背诵你的清单，就像念咒语一样，也可以在你遇到批评特别严厉和无情的时候帮助你。如果你在制作清单或填写工具箱 5 时遇到困难，请向朋友或治疗师寻求他们的意见。此外，请让我提醒你，品质不一定要完美或始终存在才能被称为品质。如果你大部分时间都是这样，那么它就是一种品质。

Finally, _positive visualization_ can be a powerful adjunct to thought-substitution. Some survivors gradually learn to short-circuit the fear-mongering processes of the critic by invoking images of past successes and accomplishments, as well as picturing safe places, loving friends or comforting memories. There are also a variety of CD’s available at places like [Amazon.com](http://www.Amazon.com) that contain guided meditations that use positive language and imagery in a way that enhances deactivation and relaxation.  
  
最后，积极的视觉化可以成为思维替代的强大辅助。一些幸存者逐渐学会通过唤起过去的成功和成就的图像，以及想象安全的地方、亲爱的朋友或安慰性的记忆，来绕过批评者的恐惧煽动过程。在像 Amazon.com 这样的地方，也有各种 CD 可供选择，其中包含使用积极语言和图像进行引导冥想的 CD，这些 CD 以增强去激活和放松的方式。
