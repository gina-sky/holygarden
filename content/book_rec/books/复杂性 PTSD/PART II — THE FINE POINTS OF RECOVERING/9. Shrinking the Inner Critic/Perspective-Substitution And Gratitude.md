\*\*Perspective-Substitution And Gratitude

视角替代与感恩\*\*

Gratitude is a delicate subject to write about because many survivors have been abused by shaming advice to “just be grateful for what you have”. Consequently many survivors totally reject the concept of gratitude and throw the baby out with the scorn-sodden bathwater. Once again, this is quite understandable when you legitimately had little to be grateful for in your childhood.

感恩是一个难以写作的主题，因为许多幸存者都曾因被羞辱性的建议“只对你所拥有的感到感激”而受到伤害。因此，许多幸存者完全拒绝感恩的概念，把婴儿连同被辱骂的洗澡水一起倒掉。当你合法地在你童年时期几乎没有什么可以感激的时候，这又是完全可以理解的。

Moreover, the concept of gratitude is damagingly used by some psychologists to support the psychological defense of denial. They tout gratitude as a fast track that can bypass traumatic pain. This is worse than absurd when applied to Cptsd survivors. It is in fact shamefully abusive to survivors because profound, extended trauma cannot be resolved until it is fully understood and worked through.

此外，感恩的概念被一些心理学家错误地用来支持否认的心理防御。他们将感恩吹捧为一条捷径，可以绕过创伤的痛苦。当应用于创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）幸存者时，这比荒谬更甚。事实上，这种做法对幸存者来说是一种可耻的滥用，因为深刻的、长期的创伤只有在完全理解和处理之后才能得到解决。

Gratitude is nevertheless a wonderful natural experience that can recurrently enhance the quality of your life. You can cultivate a perspective that is open to noticing what there is to be grateful about as long as you do not do it with the intention of creating a permanent feeling of gratitude. Over time an attitude of gratitude can gradually increase authentic gratefulness.

然而，感恩是一种美好的自然体验，可以反复提高你生活的质量。只要你不带有创造永久感恩感的意图，你就可以培养一种开放的心态，注意到值得感激的事物。随着时间的推移，感恩的态度可以逐渐增加真实的感激之情。

This can best be illustrated with the example of love. While it is of course healthy to adopt a cognitive attitude of love toward our friends and chosen family, it is impossible to feel loving all the time. If I expect that of myself, I give my inner critic endless fodder to attack me for not feeling loving enough. Similarly if I expect myself to feel grateful all the time, I keep the critic’s prodigious program of self-disappointment hale and hearty.

用爱的例子最能说明这一点。当然，对朋友和选择的家人持有爱的认知态度是健康的，但不可能一直感到爱。如果我对自己有这样的期望，我的内心批评家就会有无穷无尽的素材来攻击我，说我不够爱。同样，如果我期望自己一直感到感激，我就让批评家的自我失望计划保持旺盛和健康。

When I am temporarily stuck in a flashback feeling alienated from life, remembering what I am _usually_ grateful for in life can sometimes pull me out of the polarized negative thinking that helps keep the flashback alive.

尽管如此，与爱、感激等态度保持一致通常是有益的。当我暂时陷入回忆，感到与生活脱节时，回忆起我在生活中通常感激的事物有时能帮助我摆脱使回忆持续存在的两极化负面思维。

Invoking gratitude is particularly difficult, and often impossible at first, because flashbacks typically strand us in an emotional overwhelm that cancels out our ability to feel anything good about life. Reminding ourselves of what is worthwhile in our lives does not seem to help much in the early phases of using this tool. However, with enough practice of positive-noticing, we can sometimes relax out of a flashback by invoking our memories of gratitude.

调用感恩尤其困难，起初往往不可能，因为闪回通常会让我们陷入情绪的淹没之中，这会取消我们感受生活中任何好事的能力。提醒自己生活中值得珍惜的事物，在开始使用这个工具的早期阶段似乎并没有太大帮助。然而，通过足够的积极注意力的练习，我们有时可以通过唤起感恩的记忆来放松闪回。

When I experience this at the end of an especially long flashback, positive-noticing sometimes arises spontaneously and brings with it sweet tears of gratitude. These are also typically tears of relief, and tears of an achieved sense of belonging.

当我经历特别漫长的闪回结束时，积极注意有时会自发出现，并带来感恩的甜美泪水。这些泪水通常也是释放的泪水，以及归属感实现的泪水。

These tears typically arise unbidden, seemingly out of the blue. Typically they are positively triggered by experiences of beauty or connection, such as when flowers authentically strike me as beautiful once again, or when my appreciation of music returns and deeply moves my soul, or when I suddenly fully feel how much I love my wife, my son, my friend or my client.

这些泪水通常是不请自来的，似乎突然出现。通常它们是由美丽或联系的经历所积极触发的，比如当花朵再次真正地打动我，让我觉得美丽，或者当我欣赏音乐回归并深深地触动我的灵魂，或者当我突然完全感受到我对妻子、儿子、朋友或客户的爱。

After a painful lapse in being able to emotionally enjoy these experiences, this return brings these gratitude-laden tears which on really momentous occasions can vacillate between crying and laughing as I resurface into authentically being grateful to be alive.

在无法情感享受这些经历后的痛苦中断之后，这次回归带来了充满感激的泪水，在真正重大的时刻，这些泪水会在哭泣和欢笑之间摇摆，当我真正地感激自己还活着时，我浮出水面。

Once again, my experience is that the more I practice the thought substitution of focusing on what I am grateful for, the sooner genuine gratitude returns to me on the occasions that I lose touch with it.

再次，我的经验是，我越练习专注于我所感激的事物，在我失去这种感觉的时候，真正的感激就越快回到我身上。

[[null|]]A powerful way to practice perspective-correction is as follows. After you go to bed at night, list at least ten positive happenings of the day. More often than not these will not be peak experiences, but rather basic and simple pleasures and appreciations. They may be as simple as a catchy tune, an engaging color, a sweet scent, an enjoyable food serving of the day, a new flower in a local garden, a satisfying TV show, a neighbor’s hello, a feeling of fitness climbing the stairs, soothing words from a favorite author, or a pleasant encounter with a pet.

一种强大的练习视角校正的方法如下。在晚上睡觉前，至少列出当天十件积极的事情。通常情况下，这些不会是巅峰体验，而是基本而简单的快乐和欣赏。它们可能像一首动听的旋律、一种吸引人的颜色、一种甜美的气味、一天中令人愉悦的食物、当地花园中的一朵新花、一部令人满意的电视剧、邻居的问候、爬楼梯时的健康感、来自喜爱作者的慰藉话语，或者与宠物的愉快相遇。

Decades of this practice have helped me immeasurably to upgrade the sour perspective I inherited from my parents. Alignment with this function of the healthy observing ego provides us with a more balanced and accurate perception of life and other people.

几十年的这种实践极大地帮助我提升了从父母那里继承的消极视角。与健康观察自我这一功能的对齐，为我们提供了更加平衡和准确的关于生活和他人认识。
