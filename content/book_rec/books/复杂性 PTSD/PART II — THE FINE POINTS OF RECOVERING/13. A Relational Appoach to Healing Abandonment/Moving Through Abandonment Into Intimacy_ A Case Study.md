\*\*Moving Through Abandonment Into Intimacy: A Case Study

从放弃走向亲密：一个案例研究\*\*

A sweet, freeze-fawn client of mine suffered severe emotional abandonment in childhood. Both his parents were workaholics. They were, by definition, exceedingly unavailable. As the youngest of five children, Frank always finished last in the sibling competition for the paltry caretaking his parents had to offer. His adulthood was unfortunately a reenactment of the relational impoverishment of his childhood.

我的一个可爱的客户，一个冻鹿客户，在童年时期遭受了严重的情感放弃。他的父母都是工作狂。根据定义，他们极其不可靠。作为五个孩子中最小的一个，弗兰克总是在父母提供的微薄照顾中排在最后。他的成年生活不幸地重复了童年时期的关系贫困。

Childhood trauma left Frank hair-triggered to retreat and isolate. He had never experienced an enduring relationship. As a result of our long-term work, however, he became more motivated to seek a relationship. He successfully dated a healthy and available partner. For the first six months of their relationship, my coaching and her kind nature enabled him to show more of himself. He was rewarded by increasing feelings of relaxation and comfort while relating with her.

童年创伤让弗兰克变得容易退缩和孤立。他从未经历过一段持久的关系。然而，由于我们的长期工作，他变得更加渴望寻求关系。他成功地与一位健康且可用的伴侣约会。在他们的关系的前六个月里，我的指导和她的善良让他能够更多地展现自己。在与她相处的过程中，他感受到了越来越多的放松和舒适。

When he accepted her request to move in together, however, it became harder to hide his recurring emotional flashbacks. He was more convinced than ever that his feelings of fear, shame and depression were the most despicable of his many fatal flaws.

然而，当他接受她一起搬家的请求时，隐藏他反复出现的情感闪回变得更加困难。他比以往任何时候都更加确信，他的恐惧、羞愧和抑郁是他众多致命缺陷中最可耻的。

As we worked with this belief in therapy, he remembered many times when even the mildest dip in his mood triggered his mother to retreat into her home office. He saw that the only times his mother had a bit of time for him was on those rare occasions when he was buoyant enough to lift her spirits. He had a staunch conviction that [[null|]]social inclusion depended on him generating cheerfulness. Gloomy and abashed, he confessed: “That’s pretty hard for me, Pete. I’m not much fun to be around.”

随着我们在治疗中持有这种信念，他回想起许多次，即使是他情绪最轻微的波动，也会触发他的母亲退缩到她的家庭办公室。他看到，他母亲唯一有点时间陪他的时刻，是在他足够振奋，能够提振她精神的时候。他坚信，社交融入取决于他能否产生快乐。忧郁而羞愧，他承认：“这对我来说很难，皮特。我不太好玩。”

A codependent defense of being perpetually pleasant and agreeable had been deeply instilled in him. He could not shake off the fear that if he was not upbeat enough, his new partner would be disgusted and abandon him. He reported that his flashbacks at home had increased. Sometimes he felt a desperate need to isolate and hide. His freeze response was so activated, that he increasingly withdrew from his partner into silence. He knew that he was hiding too much in computer activities, excessive sleeping, and marathon TV sports viewing, but he could not stop.

一种永远保持愉快和和气的共生防御机制已经深深地植入他的心中。他无法摆脱这样的恐惧，如果他不够乐观，他的新伴侣会感到厌恶并离开他。他报告说，他在家的闪回增加了。有时他感到迫切需要隔离和隐藏。他的冻结反应如此强烈，以至于他越来越多地退回到沉默中，与伴侣保持距离。他知道他在电脑活动、过度睡眠和马拉松式观看电视体育节目中隐藏得太多，但他无法停止。

During his most intense flashbacks, his fear and self-disgust became so intense that he invented any excuse to get out of the house. He was besieged by thoughts and fantasies of being single again. His critic was winning the battle. He was sure his partner was as disgusted with his affect as his mother had been. He was on the verge of a literal flight response. He was about to leave, as he had before when the brief infatuation stages of his few previous relationships ended.

在他的最强烈的闪回中，他的恐惧和自我厌恶变得如此强烈，以至于他编造任何借口逃离房子。他被单身再婚的想法和幻想所困扰。他的批评家正在赢得这场战斗。他确信他的伴侣对他的情感感到厌恶，就像他的母亲曾经做的那样。他正处于一种字面上的逃避反应的边缘。他正要离开，就像他以前在短暂的热恋阶段结束时做的那样。

We spent many subsequent sessions managing these emotional flashbacks to his original abandonment. He understood more deeply that his silent withdrawals were evidence that he was flashing back. He then committed to rereading and using the 13 steps of flashback management at such times.

我们花费了接下来的许多次会话来管理他对最初被遗弃的情感闪回。他更深入地理解到，他无声的撤退是他正在闪回的证据。然后他承诺在这样的时候重新阅读并使用 13 个闪回管理步骤。

With my encouragement and gentle nudging, he grieved over his original abandonment more deeply than ever before. Over and over, he confronted the critic’s projection of his mother onto his partner.

在我的鼓励和温和的推动下，他比以往任何时候都更深刻地哀悼他最初的遗弃。一次又一次，他面对批评家将他的母亲投射到他的伴侣身上的行为。

At the same time, I encouraged Frank to be more vulnerable with his partner. He practiced doing this in role-plays with me. Encouraged by all this work, he began talking to his girlfriend about his Cptsd. A good-hearted person, she responded with sympathy [[null|]]and support. This eventually helped him to disclose that talking vulnerably made him feel even more afraid and ashamed. To his great relief, she was not only empathic but grateful for his vulnerability. She told him that his vulnerability made her feel safer to share an even deeper level of her own vulnerability. He cried poignant tears of gratitude as he told me this. I commiserated with a welling of sweet tears in my own eyes.

同时，我鼓励 Frank 在与伴侣相处时更加脆弱。他通过与我进行角色扮演来练习这一点。受到所有这些工作的鼓舞，他开始与女友谈论他的 Cptsd。她是个善良的人，用同情和支持回应了他。这最终帮助他透露，脆弱地交谈让他感到更加害怕和羞愧。令他非常欣慰的是，她不仅富有同理心，还对他的脆弱表示感激。她告诉他，他的脆弱让她感到更安全，可以分享更深层次的自己。当他告诉我这件事时，他流下了感激的泪水。我眼中涌动着甜美的泪水，与他感同身受。

Frank’s crowning achievement came some months later when he finally felt brave enough to tell her what he was experiencing while he was actually depressed. This breakthrough further enriched their intimacy. Their love expanded into those special depths of intimacy that are only achieved when people feel safe enough to communicate about anything and everything.

几个月后，Frank 取得了他的一项重大成就，当他终于鼓起勇气告诉她自己真正抑郁时的感受时。这一突破进一步丰富了他们的亲密关系。他们的爱情扩展到了只有当人们感到足够安全，可以沟通任何事情时才能达到的特殊亲密深度。

As my client became more skilled at being vulnerable, he was rewarded with the irreplaceable intimacy that comes from mutual commiseration. Over the next year, he and his future wife became such reliable sources of verbal ventilation for each other, that Frank no longer needed my services.

随着我的客户越来越擅长展现脆弱，他得到了来自相互慰藉的无可替代的亲密感。在接下来的这一年里，他和未来的妻子成为了彼此可靠的言语宣泄对象，以至于弗兰克不再需要我的服务。
