An important guideline for finding a safe enough online or in-person group: If you find that a leader or member is over-dominating a group through narcissistic behaviors such as monologing, monopolizing the time, pressuring anyone with unwanted advice or shaming anyone in anyway, please allow yourself to leave and try another group.  
  
寻找足够安全的在线或面对面小组的重要指南：如果你发现某个领导者或成员通过独白、垄断时间、施加不想要的建议或以任何方式羞辱他人等自恋行为过度控制小组，请允许自己离开并尝试另一个小组。
