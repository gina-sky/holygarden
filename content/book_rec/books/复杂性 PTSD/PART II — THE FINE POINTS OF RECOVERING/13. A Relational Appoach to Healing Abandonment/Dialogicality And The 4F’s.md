**Dialogicality And The 4F’s  
  
对话性与 4F 原则**

Because of childhood abandonment and repetition compulsion in later relationships, many 4F types are “dying” to be heard. Different types however vary considerably in their dialogical needs over the course of therapy.  
  
由于童年被遗弃和后期关系中的重复强迫，许多 4F 类型的人“渴望”被听到。然而，不同类型的人在治疗过程中的对话需求差异很大。

The _Fawn/_ Codependent type, who survived in childhood by becoming a parent’s sounding board or shoulder to cry on, may use her listening defense to encourage the therapist to do too much of the talking. With her eliciting defense, she may even invoke the careless therapist into narcissistically monologing himself.  
  
幼年时通过成为父母的倾听者或哭泣的肩膀而生存下来的鹿/依赖型，可能会利用她的倾听防御来鼓励治疗师过多地进行谈话。在她的诱导防御下，甚至可能诱使粗心的治疗师进行自我中心的独白。

The _Freeze/_Dissociative type, who learned early to seek safety in the camouflage of silence, often needs a great deal of encouragement to discover and talk about his inner experience. [[null|]]Psychoeducation can help him understand how his healthy narcissistic need to express himself was never nurtured in his family.  
  
冻结/解离型，他们从小就学会了在沉默的伪装下寻求安全，通常需要大量的鼓励来发现和谈论自己的内心体验。心理教育可以帮助他理解，他健康的自恋需求从未在家庭中得到培养。

Furthermore, freeze types can easily get lost in superficial and barely relevant free associations as they struggle to learn to talk about themselves. This of course needs to be welcomed for some time, but eventually we must help him see that his flights of fantasy or endless dream elaborations are primarily manifestations of his dissociative defense.  
  
此外，冻结型的人在学习如何谈论自己的过程中，很容易迷失在表面化和几乎不相关的自由联想中。当然，这需要一段时间内得到欢迎，但最终我们必须帮助他认识到，他的幻想之旅或无尽的梦境细化主要是他解离防御的表现。

Freeze types need to learn that emotionally disconnected talking is an old childhood habit that was developed to keep them buoyant above their undealt with emotional pain. Because of this, we must repeatedly guide them toward their feelings so that they can learn to express their most important concerns.  
  
冻结类型需要明白，情感脱节的谈话是一种童年时期形成的习惯，这种习惯是为了让他们在未处理过的情感痛苦之上保持浮动的。因此，我们必须反复引导他们去感受自己的情绪，以便他们学会表达自己最重要的关切。

The _Fight_/Narcissistic type, who often enters therapy habituated to holding court, typically dodges real intimacy with her talking defense. Therapy can actually be counterproductive for these types as months or years of uninterrupted monologing in sessions exacerbate their sense of entitlement. By providing a steady diet of uninterrupted listening, the therapist strengthens their intimacy-destroying defense of over-controlling conversations. Sooner or later, we must insert ourselves into the relationship to work on helping them learn to listen.  
  
战斗/自恋类型的人，通常习惯于在治疗中占据主导地位，往往会通过谈话防御来躲避真正的亲密关系。对于这些类型的人来说，治疗实际上可能适得其反，因为几个月或几年的不间断独白在治疗中加剧了他们的特权感。通过提供不间断的倾听，治疗师加强了他们破坏亲密关系的过度控制谈话的防御。迟早，我们必须介入他们的关系，帮助他们学会倾听。

As I write this, I remember Harry from my internship whose tiny capacity to listen to his wife evaporated as my fifty minutes of uninterrupted listening became his new norm and expectation in relationship. I felt guilty when I learned this from listening to a recorded message from his wife about how therapy was making him even more insufferable. I was relieved, however, a few years later when a different client told me that Harry’s wife eventually felt happy about this “therapeutic” change. Her husband’s increased self-centeredness was the last straw for her and she finally, with great relief, shed herself of him.  
  
当我写下这些时，我想起了我在实习期间遇到的哈里。他原本微小的倾听妻子的能力，随着我五十分钟的连续倾听变成了他对关系的常态和期望。当我从妻子的一条录音信息中得知，治疗让他变得更加难以忍受时，我感到内疚。然而，几年后，当另一位客户告诉我，哈里的妻子最终对这种“治疗性”的改变感到高兴时，我感到如释重负。她丈夫日益增加的自我中心主义成了她的最后一根稻草，她终于如释重负地摆脱了他。

[[null|]]A therapist, who is a fawn type herself, may hide in a listening and eliciting defense to avoid the scary work of gradually insinuating herself into the relationship and nudging it towards dialogicality. If we do not nudge the client to interact, there will be no recovering. For more on how to approach this, please see the end of the next section.  
  
一位像鹿一样温顺的治疗师可能会躲在倾听和诱导的防御中，以避免逐渐将自己渗透到关系中并推动其走向对话的可怕工作。如果我们不推动客户互动，就不会有恢复。关于如何接近这一点的更多内容，请参阅下一节的结尾。

The _Flight/_Obsessive-compulsive type sometimes presents as being more dialogical than other types. Like the freeze type, however, he can obsess about “safe” abstract concerns that are quite removed from his deeper issues. It is therefore up to the therapist to steer him into his deeper, emotionally based concerns to help him learn a more intimacy-enhancing dialogicality. Otherwise, the flight type can remain stuck and floundering in obsessive perseverations about superficial worries that are little more than left-brain dissociations from his repressed pain.  
  
飞行/强迫型有时表现得比其他类型更善于对话。然而，就像冻结型一样，他可能会对“安全”的抽象问题产生强迫，这些问题与他更深层的问题相去甚远。因此，治疗师需要引导他深入到基于情感的深层问题，帮助他学会更增进亲密感的对话性。否则，飞行型可能会陷入对表面担忧的强迫性坚持中，这些担忧不过是他的压抑痛苦中左脑的解离。

It is important to note here that all 4F types use left- or right-brain dissociative processes to avoid feeling and grieving their childhood losses. As dialogicality is established, it can then be oriented toward helping them to uncover and verbally and emotionally vent their ungrieved hurts.  
  
在此需要注意的是，所有 4F 类型都使用左脑或右脑的解离过程来避免感受和哀悼他们的童年损失。一旦建立了对话性，它就可以转向帮助他们揭露并口头和情感地宣泄未得到哀悼的伤痛。
