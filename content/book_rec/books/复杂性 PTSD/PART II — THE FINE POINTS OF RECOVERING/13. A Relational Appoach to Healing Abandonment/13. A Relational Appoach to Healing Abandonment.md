A RELATIONAL APPOACH TO HEALING ABANDONMENT  
  
关系式疗愈遗弃感

This chapter is a reworking of a professional article I wrote to guide therapists in their Cptsd work. I have kept that point of reference in many sections of this chapter in the hope that it will help you know what it is reasonable to expect from a therapist.  
  
本章是对我撰写的一篇专业文章的重新整理，该文章旨在指导治疗师在进行 Cptsd（创伤后应激障碍）工作时。我在本章的许多部分保留了这一参考点，希望这能帮助您了解从治疗师那里可以合理期待什么。

Further on in this chapter, there is a section on how to find a therapist. I hope this information will help you know what to look for, and ask for, when and if you are shopping for a therapist.  
  
在本章的后面部分，有一节介绍了如何寻找治疗师。我希望这些信息能帮助您了解在寻找和选择治疗师时应该寻找什么，以及提出什么要求。

Finally, if therapy is not an option for you, I end the chapter with guidelines on how to create a co-counseling relationship with a friend. If that also is not possible, I list recommendations for online forums where you can interact with others who are sharing about their recovery journeys.  
  
最后，如果治疗对您来说不是一个选择，我在本章的结尾提供了如何与朋友建立共同咨询关系的指南。如果这也无法实现，我列出了在线论坛的推荐，您可以在那里与其他分享他们康复历程的人互动。
