\*\*Emotional Self-Disclosure And Sharing Parallel Trauma History

情感自我揭露和分享平行创伤历史\*\*

Since many of my clients have sought my services after reading my somewhat autobiographical book on recovery from the dysfunctional family, self-disclosure about my past trauma is sometimes a moot point. This condition has at the same time helped me realize how powerful this kind of disclosure can be in healing shame and cultivating hope.

由于许多客户在阅读我关于从病态家庭中恢复的半自传体书籍后寻求我的服务，因此关于我过去创伤的自我揭露有时是一个无意义的问题。这种状况同时帮助我意识到这种类型的揭露在治愈羞愧和培养希望方面可以有多么强大。

Over and over, clients have told me that my vulnerable and pragmatic stories of working through my parents’ traumatizing abuse and neglect gives them the courage to engage the long difficult journey of recovering.

一次又一次，客户告诉我，我处理父母创伤性虐待和忽视的脆弱而务实的经历故事给了他们勇气去参与漫长而艰难的恢复之旅。

Now whether or not someone has read my book, I will – with appropriate clients - judiciously and sparingly share my own [[null|]]experiences of dealing with an issue they have currently brought up. I do this both to psychoeducate them and to model ways that they might address their own analogous concerns.

现在，无论某人是否读过我的书，我都会——与合适的客户——审慎而节制地分享我处理他们目前提出的问题时的个人经历。我这样做是为了进行心理教育，同时也是为了展示他们可能解决自己类似关切的方式。

One common example sounds like this: “I hate flashbacks too. Even though I get them much less than when I started this work, falling back into that old fear and shame is so awful.”

一个常见的例子听起来是这样的：“我也讨厌闪回。尽管我现在比刚开始这项工作时要少得多，但重新陷入那种旧恐惧和羞耻是如此可怕。”

I also sometimes say: “I really reverberate with your feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness around the inner critic. In the early stages of this work, I often felt overwhelmingly frustrated. It seemed that trying to shrink it actually made it worse. But now after ten thousand repetitions of thought-stopping and thought-correction, my critic is a mere shadow of its former self.”

我有时也会说：“我真的很能理解你关于内心批评者的绝望和无助感。在这项工作的早期阶段，我常常感到极度沮丧。似乎试图缩小它实际上使它变得更糟。但现在，经过一万次的思想停止和思想纠正后，我的批评者只是它以前自我的一个影子。”

A final example concerns a purely emotional self-disclosure. When a client is verbally ventilating about a sorrowful experience, I sometimes allow my tears to brim up in my eyes in authentic commiseration with their pain. The first time my most helpful therapist did this with me, I experienced a quantum leap in my trust of her.

最后一个例子是关于纯粹的情感自我披露。当客户在口头宣泄关于悲伤的经历时，我有时会允许我的眼泪在真诚的同情中充满眼眶。当我的最有帮助的治疗师第一次这样对我时，我在对她信任方面有了质的飞跃。
