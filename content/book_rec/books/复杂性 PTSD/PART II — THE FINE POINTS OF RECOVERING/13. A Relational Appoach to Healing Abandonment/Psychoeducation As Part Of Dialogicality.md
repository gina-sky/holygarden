\*\*Psychoeducation As Part Of Dialogicality

作为对话性的心理教育\*\*

Experience has taught me that clients who are childhood trauma survivors typically benefit from psychoeducation about Complex PTSD. When clients understand the whole picture of Cptsd recovery, they become more motivated to participate in the self-help practices of recovering. This also increases their overall hopefulness and general engagement in the therapeutic process. I sometimes wonder whether the rise in the popularity of Coaching has been a reaction to the various traditional forms of therapeutic neglect.

经验告诉我，童年创伤幸存者通常从关于复杂 PTSD 的心理教育中受益。当客户了解 Cptsd 恢复的全貌时，他们就会更有动力参与自我帮助实践。这也增加了他们的整体希望感以及在整个治疗过程中的参与度。我有时会想，教练的流行是否是对各种传统治疗忽视形式的反应。

One of the worst forms of therapeutic neglect occurs when the therapist fails to notice or challenge a client’s incessant, self-hating diatribes. This, I believe, is akin to tacitly approving of and silently colluding with the inner critic.

最糟糕的治疗忽视形式之一发生在治疗师未能注意到或挑战客户无休止的自我仇恨的指责。我认为，这类似于默许并暗中与内心的批评者勾结。

Perhaps therapeutic withholding and abstinence derives from the absent father syndrome that afflicts so many Westernized families. Perhaps traditional psychotherapy overemphasizes the mothering principles of listening and unconditional love, and neglects the fathering principles of encouragement and guidance that coaching specializes in.

也许治疗上的保留和节制源于困扰许多西方化家庭的缺席父亲综合症。也许传统心理治疗过度强调倾听和无条件爱的母亲原则，而忽视了教练专长的鼓励和指导的父亲原则。

Too much coaching is, of course, as counter-therapeutic and unbalanced as too much listening. It can interfere with the client’s process of self-exploration and self-discovery as described above. At its worst, it can lure the therapist into the narcissistic trap of falling in love with the sound of his own voice.

当然，过多的指导与过多的倾听一样，都是反治疗性和不平衡的。它可能会干扰客户上述的自我探索和自我发现过程。在最糟糕的情况下，它可能会诱使治疗师陷入自恋的陷阱，爱上自己声音的旋律。

At its best, coaching is an indispensable therapeutic tool. Just as it takes fathering and mothering to raise a balanced child, [[null|]]mothering and fathering principles are needed to meet the developmental arrests of the attachment-deprived client.

在最好的情况下，指导是一种不可或缺的治疗工具。正如养育一个平衡的孩子需要父爱和母爱一样，对于依恋剥夺的客户，需要母爱和父爱的原则来满足其发展停滞。

The sophisticated therapist values both and intuitively oscillates between the two, depending on the developmental needs of the client in the moment. Sometimes we guide with psychoeducation, therapeutic self-disclosure and active positive noticing, and most times we receptively nurture the client’s evolving practice of her own spontaneously arising self-expression and verbal ventilation.

成熟的治疗师重视两者，并会根据客户当下的发展需求，本能地在两者之间摇摆。有时我们通过心理教育、治疗性自我披露和积极的正面注意来引导，而大多数时候，我们则接受性地培育客户自发出现的自我表达和言语宣泄的实践。

Once again, I believe that in early therapy and many subsequent stages of therapy, the latter process typically needs to predominate. In this vein, I would guess that over the course of most therapies that I conduct, I listen about ninety percent of the time.

再次，我认为在早期治疗和许多随后的治疗阶段，后者过程通常需要占主导地位。在这方面，我猜测在我进行的多数治疗过程中，我大约有百分之九十的时间是在倾听。

Finally, I often notice that the last phase of therapy is often characterized by increasing dialogicality – a more balanced fluidity of talking and listening. This conversational reciprocity is a key characteristic of healthy intimacy. Moreover, when therapy is successful, progress in mutuality begins to serve the client in creating healthier relationships in the outside world.

最后，我经常注意到治疗阶段的最后阶段往往以增加对话性为特征——谈话和倾听的更平衡流畅性。这种对话的互惠性是健康亲密关系的关键特征。此外，当治疗成功时，相互性的进步开始帮助客户在外部世界中建立更健康的关系。
