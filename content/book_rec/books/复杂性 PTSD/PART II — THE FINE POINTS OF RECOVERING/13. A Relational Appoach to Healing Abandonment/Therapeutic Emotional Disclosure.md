\*\*Therapeutic Emotional Disclosure

治疗性情感披露\*\*

Thankfully, I eventually realized that I had unresolved attachment issues, and sought out a Relational therapist who valued the use of her own vulnerable and emotionally authentic self as a tool in therapy.

幸运的是，我最终意识到自己有未解决的依恋问题，并寻求了一位重视在治疗中使用自己脆弱和情感真实的自我作为治疗工具的关系治疗师。

Her tempered and timely emotional self-disclosures helped me to deconstruct the veneer of invincibility I had built as a child to hide my pain. Here are some examples that were especially helpful. “God, the holidays can be awful.” “I get scared when I teach a class too.” “I’m so sorry. I just missed what you said. I got a little distracted by my anxiety about my dental appointment this afternoon.” “I feel sad that your mother was so mean to you.” “It makes me angry that you were so bullied by your parents.”

她适度和及时的情感自我披露帮助我解构了我作为孩子建立起来的不可战胜的假象，以隐藏我的痛苦。以下是一些特别有帮助的例子。“上帝，假期可以很糟糕。” “当我教课时，我会感到害怕。” “很抱歉，我刚刚错过了你说的。今天下午我对牙医预约的焦虑让我有点分心。” “我为你母亲对你那么刻薄而感到难过。” “你被父母如此欺负，这让我很生气。”

My therapist’s modeling that anger, sadness, fear, and depression were emotions that could be healthily expressed helped me to renounce the pain-repressing, emotional perfectionism in which I was mired. With her, I learned to stop burying my feelings in the hope of being loved. I renounced my just-get-over-it philosophy and embraced vulnerability as a way of finally getting close to people.

我的治疗师通过模仿告诉我，愤怒、悲伤、恐惧和抑郁都是可以健康表达的情绪，这帮助我摒弃了那种让我深陷其中的压抑痛苦、情感完美的观念。在她的帮助下，我学会了不再将我的感情深埋心底，希望得到爱。我放弃了“快点克服它”的哲学，将脆弱视为一种方式，最终与人亲近。

I needed this kind of modeling, as so many of my clients have, to begin to emerge from my fear of being attacked, shamed or abandoned for feeling bad and having dysphoric feelings. In order to let go of my Sisyphean salvation fantasy of achieving constant happiness, I needed to experience that all the less than shiny bits of me were acceptable to another human being. Seeing that she was comfortable with and accepting of her own unhappy feelings eventually convinced me that she really was not disgusted by mine.

我需要这种模仿，就像我的许多客户一样，开始摆脱因感到不好和有不适情绪而害怕被攻击、羞辱或遗弃的恐惧。为了放下我那不断追求幸福的西西弗斯式救赎幻想，我需要体验到我身上所有不那么闪亮的部分都是另一个人类可以接受的。看到她对自己的不快乐情绪感到舒适并接受，最终说服了我，她并不是真的厌恶我的情绪。

Here are some self-revealing things that I say to encourage my clients to be more emotionally self-accepting. “I feel really sad about what happened to you.” “I feel really angry that you got stuck with such a god-awful family.” “When I’m temporarily confused and don’t know what to say or do, I…” “When I’m having a shame attack, I…” “When something triggers me into fear, I…” “When my inner critic is overreacting, I remind myself of the Winnicottian concept that I only have to be a ‘good enough person.’”

治疗师明智地运用情感自我披露帮助客户摆脱情感完美主义的滑溜、羞耻的陷阱。以下是我用来鼓励客户更加接受自己情感的一些自我揭露的话：“我对发生在你身上的事情感到非常难过。”“我非常生气你被这样一个糟糕的家庭困住了。”“当我暂时感到困惑，不知道该说什么或做什么时，我……”“当我遭受羞耻攻击时，我……”“当某些事情激发我的恐惧时，我……”“当我的内心批评者过度反应时，我提醒自己温尼科特的概念，我只需要成为一个‘足够好的人’。”

Here are two examples of emotional self-disclosure that are fundamental tools of my therapeutic work. I repeatedly express my genuine indignation that the survivor was taught to hate himself. Over time, this often awakens the survivor’s instinct to also feel incensed about this travesty. This then empowers him to begin standing up to the inner critic. This in turn aids him to emotionally invest in the multidimensional work of building healthy self-advocacy.

以下是两个情感自我披露的例子，这是我的治疗工作中基本工具。我反复表达我真诚的愤怒，因为幸存者被教导去恨自己。随着时间的推移，这往往唤醒幸存者对这种丑行的愤怒。然后这使他能够开始对抗内心的批评者。这反过来又帮助他在构建健康自我倡导的多维工作中投入情感。

Furthermore, I also repeatedly respond with empathy and compassion to the survivor’s suffering. With time, this typically helps to awaken the recoveree’s capacity for self-empathy. She then gradually learns to comfort herself when she is in a flashback or otherwise painful life situation. Less and less often does she surrender to an inner torture of self-hate, self-disappointment, and self-abandonment.

此外，我还反复以同理心和同情心回应幸存者的痛苦。随着时间的推移，这通常有助于唤醒康复者自我同理心的能力。然后，她逐渐学会在闪回或其他痛苦的生活情境中自我安慰。她越来越少屈服于内心的自我仇恨、自我失望和自我放弃的折磨。

My most consistent feedback from past clients is that responses like these - especially ones that normalize fear and depression – helped them immeasurably to deconstruct their perfectionism, and open up to self-compassion and self-acceptance.

我过去客户最一致的反馈是，这样的回应——尤其是那些将恐惧和抑郁正常化的回应——极大地帮助他们解构完美主义，并打开自我同情和自我接纳的大门。
