**3\. DIALOGICALITY  
  
3\. 对话性**

_Dialogicality_ occurs when two conversing people move fluidly and interchangeably between speaking \[an aspect of healthy narcissism\] and listening \[an aspect of healthy codependence.\] Such reciprocal interactions prevent either person from polarizing to a dysfunctional narcissistic or codependent type of relating  
  
当两个交谈的人流畅且交替地在说话\[健康自恋的一个方面\]和倾听\[健康共生的一个方面\]之间移动时，就会产生对话性。这种相互的互动防止任何一个人极化到一个功能失调的自恋或共生型关系。

Dialogicality energizes both participants in a conversation. Dialogical relating stands in contrast to the monological energy-theft that characterizes interactions whereby a narcissist pathologically exploits a codependent’s listening defense. Numerous people have reverberated with my observation that listening to a narcissist monologue feels as if it is draining them of energy.  
  
对话性为对话中的双方注入能量。对话性关系与单声道能量窃取形成对比，后者是自恋者病理性地利用共依存者的倾听防御的特点。许多人对我观察到的倾听自恋者的独白感觉就像是在消耗他们的能量产生了共鸣。

I have become so mindful of this dynamic that, in a new social situation, a sudden sense of tiredness often warns me that I am [[null|]]talking with a narcissist. How different than the elevation I sense in myself and my fellow conversant in a truly reciprocal exchange. Again, I wonder if there are mirror neurons involved in this.  
  
我已经对这种动态如此警觉，以至于在一个新的社交场合，突然的疲惫感常常警告我我正在和一个自恋者交谈。这与我在真正相互交流中感受到的自我提升和与我交谈的同伴的提升是多么不同。再次，我想知道是否涉及镜像神经元。

I was appalled the other day while perusing a home shopping catalog to see a set of coffee cups for sale that bore the monikers “Designated Talker” and “Designated Listener”. My wife and I pondered it for a few minutes, and hypothesized that it had to be a narcissist who designed those mugs. We imagined we could see the narcissists who order them presenting them to their favorite sounding boards as Christmas presents.  
  
那天我浏览家居购物目录时，看到一套咖啡杯出售，上面写着“指定说话者”和“指定倾听者”。我和妻子对此思考了几分钟，猜测这一定是自恋者设计的杯子。我们想象着那些订购这些杯子的人可能会把它们作为圣诞礼物送给他们最喜欢的“回音壁”。

In therapy, dialogicality develops out of a teamwork approach – a mutual brainstorming about the client’s issues and concerns. Such an approach cultivates full exploration of ambivalences, conflicts and other life difficulties.  
  
在治疗中，对话性源于团队合作方法——关于客户问题和担忧的集体头脑风暴。这种方法培养了全面探索矛盾、冲突和其他生活困难。

Dialogicality is enhanced when the therapist offers feedback from a take-it-or-leave-it stance. Dialogicality also implies _respectful mutuality_. It stands in stark contrast to the _blank screen neutrality and abstinence_ of traditional psychoanalytic therapy, which all too often reenacts the verbal and emotional neglect of childhood.  
  
对话性在治疗师采取“接受或不接受”立场提供反馈时得到增强。对话性还意味着相互尊重。它与传统心理分析治疗中的空白屏幕中立性和禁欲主义形成鲜明对比，这种治疗方式过于频繁地重现了童年时期的言语和情感忽视。

I believe abstinence commonly flashes the client back into feelings of abandonment, which triggers them to retreat into “safe” superficial disclosure, ever-growing muteness and/or early flight from therapy.  
  
我相信禁欲通常会让客户回想起被遗弃的感觉，这会促使他们退缩到“安全”的表面披露中，不断增长的沉默和/或过早地逃离治疗。
