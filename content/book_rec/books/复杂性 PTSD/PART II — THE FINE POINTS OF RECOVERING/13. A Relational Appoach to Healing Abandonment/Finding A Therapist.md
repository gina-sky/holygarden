**FINDING A THERAPIST  
  
寻找治疗师**

I have as yet to do any therapist trainings in my approach outside of the San Francisco Bay Area, so I cannot make any recommendations for therapists outside this area. However, because my approach is compatible with that of John Bradshaw’s, I refer people to a website that lists therapists around the U. S. and the World who report that they embrace his approach. The link to this is [www.creativegrowth.com/referral.htm](http://www.creativegrowth.com/referral.htm).  
  
我至今还没有在旧金山湾区以外的地方进行过任何治疗师培训，因此我无法为该地区以外的治疗师提供任何推荐。然而，由于我的方法与约翰·布拉德肖的方法兼容，我建议人们访问一个列出美国和世界各地报告接受他方法的治疗师的网站。该链接为 www.creativegrowth.com/referral.htm。

[[null|]]I and the Creative Growth Center are however unable to personally endorse these therapists as we are not personally familiar with their work. Nonetheless, I think this is a good place to start. Please begin by first reading the following recommendations for interviewing a therapist.  
  
然而，我和创意成长中心无法亲自推荐这些治疗师，因为我们并不了解他们的工作。尽管如此，我认为这是一个良好的起点。请首先阅读以下关于面试治疗师的推荐。

The purpose of the interview is to ascertain whether your potential therapist is able and willing to work at the levels I describe above. I recommend interviewing and having a trial appointment with at least three therapists, if possible, to determine if their approach is compatible enough with the one I describe above.  
  
面试的目的是确定你的潜在治疗师是否能够并且愿意在上述水平上工作。我建议尽可能与至少三位治疗师进行面试和试听，以确定他们的方法是否与我描述的上述方法足够兼容。

A suitable therapist will be happy to answer your question about their approach and generally talk with you on the phone for at least five minutes before scheduling a meeting. Should the therapist respond to you in an aloof, critical or shaming way, I would immediately cross them off your list and keep looking.  
  
一位合适的治疗师会乐意回答您关于他们方法的问题，并且通常会在安排会面之前通过电话与您交谈至少五分钟。如果治疗师以冷漠、批评或羞辱的方式回应您，我会立即将其从您的名单上划掉，并继续寻找。

Finally, it is important to note that there are many untherapized therapists who are licensed to practice psychotherapy, and my experience is that these types are rarely able to work at the depth required for guiding Cptsd recovery.  
  
最后，重要的是要注意，有许多未经治疗的咨询师拥有执业心理治疗执照，我的经验是，这类人很少能够达到引导 Cptsd 康复所需的深度。

I believe it’s appropriate to ask a prospective therapist if they have done their own therapy. I would then at least expect from him/her a response that they have and have found it helpful. Ideally, the therapist would also be willing to disclose that they have done their own family of origin work.  
  
我认为询问一位潜在的治疗师他们是否进行过自己的治疗是合适的。我至少会期望他们回答说他们进行了治疗，并且发现它是有帮助的。理想情况下，治疗师也愿意透露他们进行了自己的家庭起源工作。

[[null|]]Good luck in your search. If you live in a reasonable sized city and persevere, I think your chances of finding a “good enough” therapist are good.  
  
祝您在寻找过程中好运。如果您居住在一个合理规模的城市并且坚持不懈，我认为您找到“足够好”的治疗师的机会是很好的。
