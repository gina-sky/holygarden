**2\. AUTHENTIC VULNERABILITY “Realationship” Makes Healthy Relationship  
  
2\. 真诚的脆弱性“关系”造就健康关系**

Authentic vulnerability is a second quality of intimate relating. Authentic vulnerability often begins with emotionally reverberating with the client. I have found that emotional reflection of the client’s feelings is irreplaceable in fostering the development of trust and real relational intimacy.  
  
真诚的脆弱性是亲密关系中第二个品质。真诚的脆弱性通常从与客户情感共鸣开始。我发现，在培养信任和真正的关系亲密方面，对客户情感的反映是无可替代的。

Emotional reflection requires the therapist to be emotionally vulnerable himself and reveal that he too feels mad, sad, bad and scared sometimes. Modeling vulnerability, as with empathy, demonstrates to the client the value of being vulnerable and encourages her to risk wading into her own vulnerability.  
  
情感反映要求治疗师自己也要情感脆弱，并展示出他有时也会感到愤怒、悲伤、糟糕和害怕。与同理心一样，模仿脆弱性向客户展示了脆弱的价值，并鼓励她冒险涉足自己的脆弱之中。

I came to value therapeutic vulnerability the hard way via its absence in my own therapy with a therapist who was of the old, [[null|]]“blank screen” school. She was distant, laconic and over-withholding in her commitment to the psychoanalytic principle of “optimal frustration.” Therapy with her was actually counter-therapeutic and shame-exacerbating for me as we reenacted a defective child/perfect parent dynamic.  
  
我通过艰难的方式，在自身治疗中缺少治疗性脆弱性，才真正重视起它。我的治疗师属于老派的“空白屏幕”学派。她冷漠、寡言，对心理分析原则“最佳挫折”过度保留。和她治疗的过程中，我实际上是在进行反治疗，这让我感到羞愧，我们重演了一个有缺陷的孩子/完美的父母动态。
