**CO-COUNSELING  
  
共同咨询**

If you are not able to find or afford a “good enough” therapist, and/or if you want to supplement your current therapy as my wife and I do regularly with each other, you can look for a safe partner who is willing to work with you to mutually evolve a co-counseling relationship.  
  
如果您找不到或负担不起一位“足够好”的治疗师，或者您想像我和我的妻子那样定期互相补充当前的治疗，您可以寻找一位愿意与您共同努力发展共同咨询关系的可靠伙伴。

There are many forms of co-counseling. {Google “co-counseling” to learn more.}  
  
共同咨询有许多形式。{在谷歌上搜索“共同咨询”了解更多信息。}

My wife and I have a simple structure for establishing a safe and healing co-counseling relationship. We have been using this model for many years and derive great benefit from it. I have similarly [[null|]]benefitted from co-counseling with two wonderful friends in the past. Please feel free, of course to adapt the model to fit your own mutual needs and agreements.  
  
我和我的妻子有一个简单的结构来建立安全且有益的共同咨询关系。我们已经使用这个模式很多年了，从中获得了巨大的益处。我过去也与两位好朋友进行过共同咨询，同样受益匪浅。当然，请随意根据您双方的共同需求和协议调整这个模式。

Meet weekly and exchange 30 or 60 minute sessions.  
  
每周见面，进行 30 或 60 分钟会话。

Begin with the counselee talking about all and any of his/her concerns and with the counselor refraining from intervening other than to practice, Active Listening.  
  
开始时，由咨询者谈论他/她的所有和任何担忧，而咨询师则避免干预，除了练习，进行积极倾听。

_Active listening_ is based on an attitude of “unconditional positive regard”. It enhances the counselee’s process of full verbal ventilation, and it uses non-directive, non-intrusive verbal feedback to let the counselee know that you are attuned and paying attention to him/her.  
  
积极倾听基于“无条件积极关注”的态度。它增强了咨询者充分口头表达的过程，并使用非指导性、非侵入性的口头反馈，让咨询者知道你在关注他/她。

Active listening includes responses like “un hunh” and “mmm-hmmm” as well as a technique known as mirroring_. Mirroring_ occurs when we repeat key words or phrases that the other person says to let them know that we are paying attention to them.  
  
积极倾听包括像“嗯嗯”和“嗯嗯嗯”这样的回应，以及一种称为镜像的技术。镜像发生在我们重复对方说的关键词或短语时，以让他们知道我们在关注他们。

Advanced mirroring occurs when we paraphrase in our own words what we hear. This is only helpful however if we make an accurate translation of what’s been said.  
  
高级镜像发生在我们用自己的话复述所听到的内容时。然而，这只有在我们准确翻译了所说的内容时才有帮助。

Finally, the use of _open-ended questions_ is perhaps the penultimate active listening techniques. Questions such as “Can you tell me more about that?”, “What else happened?”, and “Do you have other thoughts and feelings about that?” can be very helpful.  
  
最后，开放式问题的使用可能是最接近积极倾听技巧的。像“你能告诉我更多关于那件事吗？”、“还发生了什么？”和“你对那件事有什么其他想法和感受？”这样的问题非常有帮助。

Opened ended questions stand in contrast to pointed questions which tend to limit or shape the way the counselee responds. “What do you think or feel about that?” allows the other person greater internal exploration than “Did you feel upset about that?” which may be perceived as a statement rather than a question. It can sound like you are telling them what they should be feeling.  
  
开放式问题与直接问题形成对比，后者往往限制或塑造了咨询者回答的方式。“你对那件事有什么想法或感受？”让另一个人有更大的内部探索空间，而“你对那件事感到不安吗？”可能被视为一个陈述而不是一个问题。它听起来像是在告诉他们他们应该有什么感受。

People vary in the amount of active listening they find helpful. Please be open to giving and receiving feedback about how much you or the other person would like.  
  
人们对他们认为有帮助的积极倾听程度各不相同。请对给予和接收关于你或另一个人希望多少的反馈持开放态度。

[[null|]]In order to establish safety and build trust, begin with a commitment to refrain from advice giving, criticism or any kind of unsolicited feedback except active listening. If and when the desire for feedback comes up, it is best to let the counselee determine when, what kind and how much they want. Feedback is best given from a take-it or leave-it perspective  
  
为了建立安全和建立信任，首先承诺避免提供建议、批评或任何形式的未经请求的反馈，除非是主动倾听。如果出现寻求反馈的愿望，最好让咨询者决定何时、什么类型以及多少反馈是他们想要的。反馈最好从接受或放弃的角度给出。

Do not give any feedback unless it is clearly asked for. The counselee often does well to be specific about the type of feedback desired, or the desire to not have any feedback; e.g., “I’d like to just verbally ventilate about my relationship, but don’t really want any feedback about it other than active listening.” At another point the counselee might like to say: “This is something I would actually like some feedback on. I’d like to know whether it seems that I’m perceiving my boss clearly.”  
  
除非明确请求，否则不要提供任何反馈。咨询者通常做得很好，具体说明想要的反馈类型，或者不希望有任何反馈；例如，“我只想口头发泄一下我的关系问题，但并不真的想要关于它的任何反馈，除了主动倾听。”在另一个时候，咨询者可能想说：“这是我想得到一些反馈的事情。我想知道我是否清楚地感知了我的老板。”

With enough grace, luck, respect, practice and compassion, mutual trust may eventually come so far that you both agree to change the structure to allow for spontaneous feedback at certain times in the session. Don’t rush to get there, and always reserve permission to invoke the no-feedback guideline for any given issue, session or indefinite number of sessions.  
  
有了足够的优雅、运气、尊重、练习和同情，相互信任最终可能会达到这样的程度，即你们双方同意改变结构，以便在会话中的某些时刻进行即兴反馈。不要急于达到那里，并且始终保留在任何给定问题、会话或无限期数量的会话中调用无反馈指南的权限。

In this vein, my wife or I might say to each other: “I think I’d just like active listening today. I’d like to just extensively free associate on and explore this anxious feeling in my chest without getting any input about it.”  
  
在这方面，我或我的妻子可能会对彼此说：“我今天只想进行主动倾听。我想只是广泛地自由联想，探索我胸中的这种焦虑感，而不想得到任何关于它的反馈。”

Practice therapeutic confidentiality. Let what is said in a session stay in the session.  
  
练习治疗保密。让会话中说的话留在会话中。

I also recommend that both partners read [[Toolbox 4. Tools for Lovingly Resolving Conflict|Toolbox 4]] in [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]], and the section above on the four key qualities of relational healing prior to commencing a co-counseling relationship.  
  
我还建议，在开始共同咨询关系之前，双方都阅读第 13 章的工具箱 4，以及关于关系治疗四个关键品质的上述部分。
