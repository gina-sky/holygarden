\*\*Meeting Healthy Narcissistic Needs

会议满足健康的自恋需求\*\*

All this being said, extensive dialogicality is often inappropriate in the early stages of therapy. This is especially true, when the client’s normal narcissistic needs have never been gratified, and remain developmentally arrested.

尽管如此，在治疗初期，广泛的对话性往往是不恰当的。这尤其适用于那些客户的正常自恋需求从未得到满足，并且仍然处于发育停滞状态的情况。

In such cases, clients need to be extensively heard. They need to discover through the agency of spontaneous self-expression the nature of their own feelings, needs, preferences and views.

在这种情况下，客户需要被广泛倾听。他们需要通过自发自我表达的方式，发现自身的感觉、需求、偏好和观点的本质。

[[null|]]For those survivors whose self-expression was especially decimated by their caretakers, self-focused verbal exploration typically needs to be the dominant activity for a great deal of time. Without this, the unformed healthy ego has no room to grow and break free from the critic. The client’s healthy sense of self remains imprisoned beneath the hegemony of the outsized superego.

对于那些被照顾者特别摧毁了自我表达能力的幸存者，以自我为中心的言语探索通常需要成为一段很长时间内的主要活动。没有这种探索，未形成健康的自我无法成长并摆脱批评者的束缚。客户的健康自我意识仍然被过大的超我霸权所囚禁。

This does not mean, however, that the client benefits when the therapist retreats into extremely polarized listening. Most benefit, as early as the first session, from hearing something real or “personal” from the therapist. This helps overcome the shame-inducing potential that arises in the “One-seen \[client\] / One-unseen \[therapist\]” dynamic. When one person is being vulnerable and the other is not, shame has a huge universe in which to grow. This also creates a potential for the client to get stuck flashing back to childhood when the vulnerable child was rejected over and over by the seemingly invulnerable parent.

然而，这并不意味着当治疗师退入极端两极化的倾听时，客户就会受益。大多数客户，从第一次会话开始，就受益于听到治疗师的真实或“个人”的东西。这有助于克服“一人可见\[客户\] / 一人不可见\[治疗师\]”动态中产生的羞耻感。当一个人在表现出脆弱而另一个人没有时，羞耻感就有了一个巨大的空间去生长。这也为客户陷入回忆童年，当脆弱的孩子一次又一次被看似不可战胜的父母拒绝时，创造了可能性。

Consequently, many of my colleagues see group therapy as especially powerful for healing shame, because it rectifies this imbalance by creating a milieu where it is not just one person who is risking being vulnerable.

因此，许多同事认为团体治疗对于治愈羞耻感特别有效，因为它通过创造一个环境，让不止一个人面临风险而变得脆弱，来纠正这种不平衡。

In this regard, it is interesting to note a large survey of California therapists that occurred about fifteen years ago. The survey was about their therapy preferences, and upwards of ninety percent emphasized that they did not want a blank screen therapist, but rather one who occasionally offered opinions and advice.

在这方面，值得注意的是，大约十五年前进行的一项关于加利福尼亚治疗师的大型调查。该调查关于他们的治疗偏好，超过百分之九十的人强调他们不希望有一个空白屏幕的治疗师，而更希望有一个偶尔提供意见和建议的人。

For twenty-five years, I have been routinely asking clients in the first session: “Based on your previous experiences in therapy, what would you like to happen in our work together; and what don’t you want to happen?” How frequently clients respond similarly to the therapists in the survey!

对于二十五年，我在第一次会面时都会例行公事地问客户：“根据你之前在治疗中的经历，你希望在我们的合作中发生什么；你不想发生什么？”客户们多么频繁地以类似的方式回应治疗师！

Moreover, the next most common response I receive is that I don’t want a therapist who does all the talking. More than a few have used the exact phrase: “I couldn’t get a word in edgewise!” [[null|]]How I wish there was a way that our qualification tests could spot and disqualify the narcissists who do get licensed and then turn their already codependent clients into sounding boards. This is the shadowy flipside polarity of the blank screen therapist.

此外，我收到的下一个最常见的回应是，他们不希望治疗师一直说话。不止几个人用了完全相同的短语：“我根本插不上话！”我多么希望我们的资格测试能够发现并淘汰那些获得执照后却将他们的依赖性极强的客户变成自己的回音壁的利己主义者。这是空白屏幕治疗师的阴暗面，是它的对立面。
