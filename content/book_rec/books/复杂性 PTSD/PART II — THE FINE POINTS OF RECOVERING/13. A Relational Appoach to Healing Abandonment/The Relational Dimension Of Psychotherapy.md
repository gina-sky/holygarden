\*\*The Relational Dimension Of Psychotherapy

心理治疗的关系维度\*\*

Many Cptsd survivors have never had a “safe enough” relationship. Healing our attachment disorders usually requires a reparative relational experience with a therapist, partner or trusted friend who is able to stay compassionately present to their own painful and dysphoric feelings. It is essential that they are comfortable with feeling and expressing their own sadness, anger, fear, shame and depression.

许多创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的幸存者从未有过“足够安全”的关系。治疗我们的依恋障碍通常需要与治疗师、伴侣或信任的朋友进行修复性关系体验，他们能够以同情心持续地面对自己的痛苦和不适感。他们必须能够舒适地感受和表达自己的悲伤、愤怒、恐惧、羞愧和抑郁。

When a therapist has this level of emotional intelligence, she can guide the client to gradually let go of the learned habit of automatically rejecting his feelings. This in turn also helps him to avoid getting lost in the cycles of reactivity we explored in the last chapter.

当治疗师具备这种程度的情绪智力时，她可以引导客户逐渐放弃自动拒绝自己感受的学习习惯。这反过来也有助于他避免陷入我们在上一章中探讨的反应循环。

Safe and empathic eye and voice connection with a therapist who has “good enough” emotional intelligence models to the client how to stay acceptingly present to all her own affects.

与拥有“足够好”情绪智力的治疗师进行安全和同理心的眼神和声音连接，为客户树立了如何接受地面对自己所有情绪的榜样。

Daniel Siegel calls this the “coregulation of affect.” Moreover, Susan Vaughan’s work demonstrates that this _coregulation of affect_ promotes the development of the inner neural circuitry necessary to metabolize overwhelmingly painful feelings.

丹尼尔·西格尔称之为“情感共调节”。此外，苏珊·沃恩的工作表明，这种情感共调节促进了发展内神经网络，这对于代谢压倒性的痛苦情感是必要的。

Furthermore, there is increasing neuroscientific evidence suggesting that this process is physiologically accomplished through the agency of a set of neurons called mirror neurons. In one experiment measuring neural activity in two monkeys, one monkey watched as the other cracked open a nut. The observer’s neural activity was identical to the performers. Perhaps mirror neurons are involved when the client learns to be as non-reactive to his painful feelings as the therapist.

此外，越来越多的神经科学证据表明，这个过程是通过一组被称为镜像神经元的中枢神经系统的作用在生理上完成的。在一个测量两只猴子神经活动的实验中，一只猴子观察另一只猴子砸开坚果。观察者的神经活动与表演者相同。也许当客户学会像治疗师一样对他的痛苦感受不做出反应时，镜像神经元就参与其中了。
