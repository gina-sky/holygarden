**Earned Secure Attachment  
  
获得安全依恋**

In therapy, clients get the most out of their session by learning to stay in interpersonal contact while they communicate from their emotional pain. This gradually shows them that they are acceptable and worthwhile no matter what they are feeling and experiencing.  
  
在治疗中，客户通过学会在沟通情感痛苦的同时保持人际接触，从而最大限度地利用他们的会话。这逐渐向他们表明，无论他们感受到什么，经历什么，他们都是可接受的、有价值的。

As survivors realize more deeply that their flashbacks are normal responses to abnormal childhood conditions, their shame begins to melt. This then eases their fear of being seen as defective. In turn, their habits of isolating or pushing others away during flashbacks diminish.  
  
随着幸存者越来越深刻地意识到他们的闪回是对异常童年条件的正常反应，他们的羞愧开始消融。这随后减轻了他们被看作是有缺陷的恐惧。反过来，他们在闪回期间孤立自己或推开他人的习惯也减少了。

Earned secure attachment is a newly recognized category of healthy attachment. Many attachment therapists believe that effective treatment can help a survivor “earn” at least one truly intimate [[null|]]relationship. Earned secure attachment is the good enough and intimacy-rich attachment discussed throughout this book.  
  
获得安全的依恋是一种新被认可的依恋类型。许多依恋治疗师认为，有效的治疗可以帮助幸存者“获得”至少一段真正亲密的关系。获得安全的依恋是本书中讨论的足够好且充满亲密感的依恋。

I believe the principles outlined in this chapter are keys to achieving an earned secure attachment. In this vein, good therapy can be an intimacy-modeling relationship. It fosters our leaning and practicing of intimacy-making behavior. Your connection with your therapist can become _a transitional earned secure attachment_. This in turn can lead to the attainment of an earned secure attachment outside of therapy. I have repeatedly seen this result with my most successful clients, and I am grateful to report that my last experience with my own therapy lead me to this reward.  
  
我相信本章中概述的原则是实现获得安全的依恋的关键。在这方面，良好的治疗可以成为一种亲密关系模型。它促进我们学习和实践建立亲密关系的行为。你与治疗师的关系可以成为一种过渡性的获得安全的依恋。这反过来又可能导致在治疗之外获得获得安全的依恋。我反复看到我的最成功客户取得了这样的结果，我很高兴报告说，我自己的最后一次治疗经历让我得到了这个回报。
