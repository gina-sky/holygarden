**4\. COLLABORATIVE RAPPORT REPAIR  
  
4\. 协作关系修复**

_Collaborative rapport repair_ is the process by which relationships recover and grow closer from successful conflict resolution. Misattunements and periods of disaffection are existential to every relationship of substance. We all need to learn a process for restoring intimacy when a disagreement temporarily disrupts our feeling of being safely connected.  
  
协作关系修复是关系通过成功的冲突解决而恢复和更加紧密的过程。误解和不和谐的时刻对于任何有实质性的关系都是存在的。我们都需要学习一种在分歧暂时破坏我们感到安全连接的感觉时恢复亲密关系的方法。

I believe most people, if they think about it, realize that their best friends are those with whom they have had a conflict and found a way to work through it. Once a friendship survives a hurtful [[null|]]misattunement, it generally means that it has moved through the fair-weather-friends stage of relationship.  
  
我相信，如果人们认真思考，会意识到他们最好的朋友是那些他们曾经有过冲突并找到解决方法的人。一旦友谊度过了伤害性的误解，通常意味着它已经超越了只有顺境时才存在的友谊阶段。

Synchronistic with re-editing this last section, my son uncharacteristically got into a conflict at school. During third grade recess two of his good friends, also uncharacteristically, started teasing him, and when they would not stop he pushed each of them. This earned them all a trip to the principal’s office. The principal is a strict but exceptionally wise and kind woman. My son’s offense, using physical force to resolve a conflict, was judged as the most serious violation of school policy, but his friends’ were also held responsible for their part and given an enlightening lecture on teasing.  
  
与重新编辑这一节同步，我的儿子在学校里不寻常地发生了冲突。在三年级课间休息时，他的两个好朋友也出人意料地开始取笑他，当他们不停的时候，他推了他们每个人。这让他们都去了校长办公室。校长是一个严格但非常聪明和善良的女性。我儿子使用身体力量来解决冲突的行为被认为是最严重的违反校规，但他的朋友们也因他们的部分责任而受到责备，并接受了关于取笑的启发式讲座。

My son, not used to being in trouble, had a good cry about it all. He then agreed that a one day loss of recess plus writing letters of apology to his friends were fair consequences. Two days later, I asked him how things were going now between him and the two friends. With a look of surprise and delight, he told me: “It’s really funny, daddy. Now, it feels like we’re even better friends than we were before.”  
  
我儿子不习惯于陷入麻烦，为此大哭了一场。然后他同意一天失去课间休息时间，并给朋友们写道歉信是公平的后果。两天后，我问他现在他和那两个朋友之间的情况如何。他带着惊讶和喜悦的表情告诉我：“真的很搞笑，爸爸。现在，感觉我们比以前更好了。”

Rapport repair is probably the most transformative, intimacy-building process that a therapist can model. I guide this process from a perspective that recognizes that there is usually a mutual contribution to any misattunement or conflict. Therefore, a mutually respectful dialogical process is typically needed to repair rapport. Exceptions to this include scapegoating and upsets that are instigated by a bullying narcissist. In those situations, they are solely at fault. I have often been saddened by codependent clients who apologize to their bullying parents as if they made their parents abuse them.  
  
关系修复可能是治疗师可以示范的最具变革性、建立亲密感的过程。我从认识到任何失调或冲突通常都有相互贡献的角度引导这个过程。因此，通常需要一个相互尊重的对话过程来修复关系。例外情况包括被推卸责任和由霸凌型自恋者引发的困扰。在这些情况下，他们完全有错。我常常为那些像自己让父母虐待一样向霸凌父母道歉的共依存客户感到悲伤。

In more normal misattunements, I often initiate the repair process with two contiguous interventions. Firstly, I identify the [[null|]]misattunement \[e.g., “I think I might have misunderstood you.”\] And secondly, I then model vulnerability by describing what I think might be my contribution to the disconnection.  
  
在更常见的失调情况中，我通常通过两次连续干预来启动修复过程。首先，我识别失调\[例如，“我想我可能误解了你。”\]其次，我通过描述我认为可能是导致脱节的原因来模拟脆弱性。

Abbreviated examples of this are: “I think I may have just been somewhat preachy…or tired…or inattentive…or impatient…or triggered by my own transference.” Owning your part in a conflict validates the normality of relational disappointment and the art of amiable resolution.  
  
简化的例子有：“我想我可能有点过于说教……或者累了……或者不够专注……或者不耐烦……或者被自己的移情所触发。”承认自己在冲突中的责任，可以证明关系失望的常态和友好解决的艺术。

Taking responsibility for your role in a misunderstanding also helps to deconstruct the client’s outer critic belief that relationships have to be perfect. At the same time, it models a constructive approach to resolving conflicts, and over time leads most clients to become interested in exploring their contribution to the conflict. This becomes an invaluable skill which they can then take into their outside relationships.  
  
承担责任，承认自己在误解中的角色，也有助于打破客户对外在批评信念的解构，即关系必须完美。同时，这为解决冲突提供了一个建设性的方法，随着时间的推移，大多数客户会对探索自己对冲突的贡献产生兴趣。这成为一项无价的技能，他们可以将其应用于外部关系。

As one might expect, fight types are the least likely of the 4F’s to collaborate and own their side of the street in a misattunement. Extreme fight types such as those diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder have long been considered untreatable in traditional psychoanalysis for this reason.  
  
正如人们所预期的，战斗型是最不可能在 4F 中合作并承担自己在失调中的责任。极端的战斗型，如被诊断为自恋型人格障碍的人，长期以来一直被认为在传统精神分析中无法治疗，原因就在于此。

With less extreme fight types, I sometimes succeed in psycho-educating them on how they learned their controlling defenses. From there I try to help them see how much they pay for being so controlling. At the top of the list of debits is intimacy-starvation. Consciously or not, they hunger for human warmth and they do not get it from those whom they control. Victims of fight types are too afraid of them to relax enough to generate authentically warm feelings.  
  
对于不太极端的战斗型，我有时能成功地通过心理教育让他们了解自己是如何学会控制性防御的。从那里，我试图帮助他们看到他们为如此控制付出了多少代价。在债务清单的顶端是亲密关系的匮乏。无论是有意还是无意，他们都渴望人类的温暖，却无法从他们控制的人那里得到。战斗型的受害者过于害怕他们，以至于无法放松到足以产生真诚温暖的程度。

Finally, I believe one of the most common reasons that clients terminate prematurely is the gradual accumulation of dissatisfactions [[null|]]that they do not feel safe enough to bring up or talk about. How sad it is that all kinds of promising relationships wither and die from an individual or couple’s inability to safely work through differences and conflict. Please see [[Toolbox 4. Tools for Lovingly Resolving Conflict|Toolbox 4]] in [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]] for a list of many pragmatic tools to “Lovingly Resolving Conflict.”  
  
最后，我认为客户提前终止合作的最常见原因之一是他们逐渐积累的不满，他们觉得不够安全，不敢提出或谈论。多么悲哀啊，各种有希望的关系因为个人或情侣无法安全地处理差异和冲突而枯萎死亡。请参阅第 13 章的工具箱 4，其中列出了许多实用的工具来“充满爱意地解决冲突”。
