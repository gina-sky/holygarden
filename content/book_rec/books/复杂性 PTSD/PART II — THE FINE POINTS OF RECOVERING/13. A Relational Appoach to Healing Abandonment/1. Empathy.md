**1\. EMPATHY  
  
1\. 同理心**

I used to assume that the merits of _empathy_ were a given, but I have sadly heard too many stories of empathy-impoverished therapy. In this regard, I will simply say here that if we are hard and unsympathetic with our clients, we trigger the same sense of danger and abandonment in them that they experienced with their parents.  
  
我曾经认为同理心的优点是理所当然的，但遗憾的是，我听到了太多关于缺乏同理心的治疗故事。在这方面，我只想简单地说，如果我们对客户强硬且缺乏同情心，我们会在他们身上引发与父母经历相同的危险和被遗弃的感觉。

In terms of a definition, I especially like Kohut’s statement that: “Empathy involves immersing yourself in another’s psychological state by feeling yourself into the other’s experience.”  
  
在定义方面，我特别喜欢科胡特的说法：“同理心意味着通过将自己融入他人的经历中，沉浸在他人的心理状态。”

When I delve deeply enough into a client’s experience, no matter how initially perplexing or intemperate it may at first seem, I inevitably find psychological sense in it, especially when I recognize its flashback components. In fact, I can honestly say that I have never met a feeling or behavior that did not make sense when viewed through the lenses of transference and traumatology.  
  
当我深入探究客户的经历时，无论起初看起来多么令人困惑或情绪化，我总会从中发现心理上的意义，尤其是在我认识到其闪回成分时。事实上，我可以诚实地说我从未遇到过在移情和创伤学视角下没有意义的情感或行为。

Empathy, of course, deepens via careful listening and full elicitation of the client’s experience, along with the time-honored techniques of mirroring and paraphrasing which show the client the degree to which we get him.  
  
同理心当然是通过仔细倾听和充分挖掘客户经历，以及传统的镜像和释义技巧来深化的，这些技巧向客户展示我们理解他的程度。

Noticing my subjective free associations often enhances my empathic attunement and ability to reflect back to the client in an emotionally accurate and validating way. When appropriate, I sometimes share my autobiographical free associations with the client [[null|]]when they are emotionally analogous. I do this to let her know that I really empathize with what she is sharing.  
  
注意到我的主观自由联想往往增强了我的同理心调谐和以情感准确且验证的方式向客户反馈的能力。当合适时，我有时会与客户分享我的自传体自由联想，当他们的情感相似时。我这样做是为了让她知道我真的理解她所分享的内容。

This is an example of this. My client tells me with great embarrassment that she stayed home all weekend because she had a pimple on her nose. She is ashamed of the pimple and of her “vanity’’ about it. She moans: “How could I be so stupid to let such a little thing bother me?” I suddenly remember cancelling a date once when I had a cold sore. At the time, I also got lost in a toxic shame attack. I share this with her, minus present day shame about it. She tears up and then laughs, relieved as her shame melts away. Months later, she tells me that her trust in me mushroomed at that moment. Guidelines for being judicious about this kind of self-disclosure will be discussed below.  
  
这是一个例子。我的客户非常尴尬地告诉我，她整个周末都待在家里，因为她鼻子上的痘痘。她为自己的痘痘和“虚荣心”感到羞愧。她抱怨道：“我怎么会这么愚蠢，让这么小的事情困扰我？”我突然想起有一次我因为长了一颗唇疱疹而取消了一次约会。当时，我也陷入了有毒的羞愧攻击中。我把这件事告诉她，没有提及现在的羞愧。她哭了起来，然后笑了，当她感到羞愧消散时，她感到如释重负。几个月后，她告诉我，那一刻她对我的信任像蘑菇一样增长。下面将讨论关于这种自我披露的审慎指南。

Of the many benefits of empathy, the greatest is perhaps that it models and teaches self-empathy, better known as self-acceptance. To the degree that we attune to and welcome all of the client’s experience, to that same degree can the client learn to welcome it in her- or himself.  
  
同理心的众多益处中，最大的可能就是它塑造并教授了自我同理心，也就是更广为人知的自我接纳。我们在多大程度上调整自己并欢迎客户的全部体验，客户就能在多大程度上学会在自己身上欢迎这些体验。
