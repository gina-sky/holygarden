[[null|]]Many traumatologists see attachment disorder as one of the key symptoms of Complex PTSD. In the psychoeducational phases of working with traumatized clients, I typically describe attachment disorder as the result of growing up with primary caretakers who were regularly experienced as dangerous. They were dangerous by contemptuous voice or heavy hand, or more insidiously, dangerous by remoteness and indifference.  
  
许多创伤学家认为依恋障碍是复杂 PTSD 的关键症状之一。在与创伤客户合作的心理学教育阶段，我通常将依恋障碍描述为在成长过程中与经常被视为危险的初级照顾者共同生活的结果。他们通过轻蔑的语气或严厉的举止表现出危险，或者更微妙地，通过冷漠和疏远表现出危险。

Recurring abuse and neglect habituates children to living in fear and sympathetic nervous system arousal. It makes them easily triggerable into the abandonment mélange of overwhelming fear and shame that tangles up with the depressed feelings of being abandoned.  
  
反复的虐待和忽视使孩子习惯于生活在恐惧和交感神经系统的兴奋中。这使得他们很容易被触发进入被遗弃的混合状态，这种状态由压倒性的恐惧和羞愧交织在一起，与被遗弃的抑郁情绪纠缠不清。

A child, with parents who are unable or unwilling to provide safe enough attachment, has no one to whom she can bring her whole developing self.  
  
如果一个孩子与无法或不愿意提供足够安全依恋的父母在一起，她就没有人可以带着她正在成长的全人自我去寻求。

No one is there for reflection, validation and guidance. No one is safe enough to go to for comfort or help in times of trouble. There is no one to cry to, to protest unfairness to, and to seek compassion from for hurts, mistakes, accidents, and betrayals.  
  
没有人可以提供反思、验证和指导。没有人足够安全，可以在遇到麻烦时寻求安慰或帮助。没有人可以哭泣、抗议不公平，以及寻求对伤害、错误、意外和背叛的同情。

No one is safe enough to shine with, to do “show and tell” with, and to be reflected as a subject of pride. There is no one to even practice the all-important intimacy-building skills of conversation.  
  
没有人足够安全，可以与之闪耀，与之“展示与讲述”，以及作为骄傲的主题被反射。没有人可以练习至关重要的建立亲密关系的对话技巧。

In the paraphrased words of more than one of my clients: “Talking to Mom was like giving ammunition to the enemy. Anything I said could and would be used against me. No wonder, people always tell me that I don’t seem to have much to say for myself.”  
  
用我多位客户的话来说： “和妈妈说话就像给敌人提供弹药。我说的一切都可能被用来对付我。难怪，人们总是说我似乎没有什么话要说。”

Those with Cptsd-spawned attachment disorders never learn the communication skills that engender closeness and a sense of belonging. When it comes to relating, they are often plagued by debilitating social anxiety - and social phobia when they are at the severe end of the continuum of Cptsd.  
  
那些由 Cptsd 引起的依恋障碍者从未学会产生亲密感和归属感的沟通技巧。在关系方面，他们常常受到令人衰弱的社交焦虑——以及当他们在 Cptsd 的严重端点时，社交恐惧症的困扰。

Many of the clients who come through my door have never had a safe enough relationship. Repetition compulsion drives them to [[null|]]unconsciously seek out relationships in adulthood that traumatically reenact the abusive and/or abandoning dynamics of their childhood caretakers.  
  
许多走进我办公室的客户从未有过足够安全的关系。重复强迫症驱使他们无意识地寻求成年期的关系，这些关系在创伤性地重演他们童年照顾者的虐待和/或遗弃动态。

For many such clients, we are their first legitimate shot at a safe and nurturing relationship. If we are not skilled enough to create the degree of safety they need to begin the long journey towards developing good enough trust, we may be their last.  
  
对于许多这样的客户，我们是他们第一次尝试建立安全且充满关怀的关系。如果我们没有足够的技能来创造他们开始漫长信任建立之旅所需的安全感，我们可能就是他们的最后一次机会。

Emotional flashback management, therefore, is empowered when it is taught in the context of a safe relationship. Clients need to feel safe enough with their therapist to describe their humiliation and overwhelm. At the same time, the therapist needs to be nurturing enough to provide the empathy and calm support that was missing in the client’s early experience.  
  
情感回溯管理因此，在安全关系背景下进行时更具效力。客户需要感到足够安全，能够向治疗师描述他们的羞辱和压倒性情绪。同时，治疗师需要足够滋养，以提供客户早期经历中缺失的同理心和冷静支持。

Just as importantly, the therapist needs to be able to tolerate and work therapeutically with the sudden evaporation of trust that is so characteristic of Cptsd. Trauma survivors do not have a volitional “on” switch for trust, even though their “off” switch is frequently automatically triggered during flashbacks. In therapy, the therapist must be able to work on reassurance and trust restoral over and over again. I have heard too many disappointing client stories about past therapists who got angry at them because they would not simply choose to trust them.  
  
同样重要的是，治疗师需要能够容忍并与 Cptsd 中如此典型的信任突然蒸发进行治疗性工作。创伤幸存者没有意志上的信任“开启”开关，尽管他们的“关闭”开关在闪回时经常被自动触发。在治疗中，治疗师必须能够一次又一次地专注于安慰和恢复信任。我听过太多令人失望的客户故事，关于过去的治疗师因为他们不愿意简单地选择信任他们而对他们发怒。

As the importance of this understanding ripens in me, I increasingly embrace an Intersubjective or Relational approach. That means that I believe that the quality of the clients’ relationship with me can provide a corrective emotional experience that saves them from being doomed to a lifetime of superficial connection, or worse, social isolation and alienation.  
  
随着我对这种理解的重要性日益加深，我越来越倾向于接受一种主观间或关系性的方法。这意味着我相信，客户与我之间的关系质量可以提供一种纠正性的情感体验，使他们免于注定要过上表面化的生活，或者更糟，社会孤立和疏远。

Moreover, I notice that without the development of a modicum of trust with me, my Cptsd clients are seriously delimited in their [[null|]]receptivity to my guidance, as well as to the ameliorative effects of my empathy.  
  
此外，我发现，如果没有与我建立一定程度的信任，我的 Cptsd 客户对我的指导以及我的同理心的改善效果都受到了严重的限制。

In this regard then, I will describe four key qualities of relating that I believe are essential to the development of trust, and the subsequent relational healing that can come out of it. These are Empathy, Authentic Vulnerability, Dialogicality and Collaborative Relationship Repair.  
  
因此，我将描述四个我认为对于建立信任以及由此产生的后续关系修复至关重要的关键品质。这些是同理心、真诚的脆弱性、对话性和协作性关系修复。
