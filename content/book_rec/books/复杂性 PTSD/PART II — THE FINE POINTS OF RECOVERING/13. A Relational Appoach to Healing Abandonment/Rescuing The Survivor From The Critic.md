**Rescuing The Survivor From The Critic  
  
拯救幸存者脱离批评**

I will conclude this section with a final note to therapists. The term _rescuing_ and what it represents has become taboo in many psychotherapy circles and in the 12-Step Movement (e.g. AA, CODA and ACA). The word “rescuing” is often used in such an all-or-none way that any type of active helping is pathologized. However, I believe that helping survivors out of the abyss of emotional flashbacks is a necessary form of rescuing.  
  
我将以此部分的一个最终笔记来结束。术语“拯救”及其所代表的意义在许多心理治疗领域和 12 步运动（例如 AA、CODA 和 ACA）中已成为禁忌。这个词“拯救”常常被以全有或全无的方式使用，以至于任何形式的积极帮助都被病理化。然而，我相信帮助幸存者摆脱情感闪回的深渊是一种必要的拯救形式。

A key place to practice healthy rescuing is in the realm of the critic. I believe there is an unmet childhood need for rescue that I help meet when I “save” my client from the critic, the proxy of her parents. This is the need no one met. The child was not rescued from her traumatizing parent. This was terrible neglect on the part of the other parent, the relatives, the neighbors or teachers who ignored the signs that she was withering from being abused.  
  
一个练习健康救援的关键地方是在批评者的领域。我相信有一个未满足的童年救援需求，当我“拯救”我的客户从批评者那里，也就是她的父母的代理人那里时，我帮助满足了这一需求。这是没有人能满足的需求。孩子没有被从受创伤的父母那里拯救出来。这是其他父母、亲戚、邻居或老师忽视她因受虐待而枯萎的迹象的可怕疏忽。

Decades of trauma work have taken me to a place where my heart no longer allows me to be silent when someone’s inner critic [[null|]]is on the attack. Silence, in my mind, is equivalent to tacit approval. I can no longer sit quietly and not intervene when survivors abuse themselves with their parents’ internalized voice.  
  
几十年的创伤工作让我到了一个地方，我的内心不再允许我在某人的内在批评家发起攻击时保持沉默。在我的想法中，沉默等同于默许。我不能再安静地坐着，不介入当幸存者用父母内化的声音自我伤害时。

I am additionally motivated to challenge the client’s toxic critic because of the failure of my first long-term experience of psychoanalytic therapy. My “blank screen” therapist let me flounder endlessly in attacking myself with self-hate and self-disgust. Never once did she point out that I could and should challenge this anti-self behavior. UCSF trauma expert Harvey Peskin would call this a failure to bear witness to the traumatization of the child.  
  
我之所以想要挑战客户的毒舌批评，还因为我第一次长期心理分析治疗经验的失败。我的“空白屏幕”治疗师让我无休止地陷入自我仇恨和自我厌恶的攻击中。她从未指出我可以也应该挑战这种反自我行为。加州大学旧金山分校创伤专家哈维·佩斯金会称这为未能见证儿童的创伤。

I now vocally challenge the critic’s lies and slanders, and I try to give the survivor a hand to climb out of the abyss of fear and shame into which the critic has pushed him.  
  
我现在公开挑战批评者的谎言和诽谤，并试图帮助幸存者从批评者推入的恐惧和羞耻的深渊中爬出来。

It took me some time to break through the dysfunctional guilt that my early training instilled in me about rescuing. Now, ironically, when I feel guilty, it is sometimes because I have regressed and let the inner critic get away with abusing my friend or my client. This guilt is actually healthy emotional intelligence. It comes from my empathy as a _right action_\-call to challenge the critic. At such times, I feel derelict in my human and professional duty if I do not bring attention to how he is hoisting himself on his parents’ petard.  
  
我花了些时间才克服了早期训练中关于救援的不健康罪恶感。现在，讽刺的是，当我感到罪恶时，有时是因为我退步了，让内心的批评家得以滥用我的朋友或客户。这种罪恶感实际上是健康的情绪智力。它来自我的同理心，作为正确行动的召唤，去挑战批评家。在这样的时刻，如果我不关注他是如何利用父母的宠溺来提升自己，我会感到在人类和职业责任上有所疏忽。

Gratefully, I can no longer passively collude with the internalized critical parent by failing to actively notice it like all those other adults did while he was growing up. If an adult does not protest when a child is being attacked with destructive criticism, she is in an unspoken alliance with the critic. The child is forced to assume contempt is normal and acceptable. The witnessing adult has forsaken her/his tribal responsibility to protect the child from parents who perpetrate child abuse.  
  
感激的是，我不再能像那些其他成年人一样，在他成长过程中被动地与内化的批判性父母同流合污，未能积极注意到它。如果一个成年人在孩子遭受破坏性批评时没有抗议，她与批评者达成了无声的联盟。孩子被迫认为蔑视是正常和可接受的。目睹这一切的成年人都放弃了她的/他的部落责任，未能保护孩子免受施虐父母的伤害。

When I label the traumatizing behavior of the client’s parents as contemptible, I begin the awakening of his developmentally arrested need for self-protection. I model to him that he should [[null|]]have been protected, and that he can now resist mimicking their abuse in his own psyche. With most of my clients, this eventually encourages disidentification from the aggressor and weakens the internalization of the attacking parent as the locus of the critic.  
  
当我把客户父母的创伤性行为称为可鄙时，我开始唤醒他发育停滞的自我保护需求。我向他展示他本应得到保护，并且他现在可以抵制在自己的心理上模仿他们的虐待。对于我的大多数客户来说，这最终鼓励他们与施暴者去认同，并削弱了将攻击性父母作为批评焦点的内化。

In my own case, I felt loved by my grandmother who lived with my family, but she failed to help me see that my parents’ vitriolic rages were wrong and not my fault. In retrospect, I believe that her neglect crystallized my belief that I deserved their abuse. The stage was then set for me to morph their contempt into self-loathing. I did this chapter and verse for nearly two decades.  
  
在我自己的情况下，我感觉到祖母的爱，她与我家同住，但她未能帮助我看到父母的恶言恶语是错误的，不是我的错。回顾过去，我相信她的忽视使我相信我应得的虐待。然后，我就可以将他们的蔑视转化为自我厌恶。我这样做了近二十年。

I have also noticed a significant difference in survivors who were helped in childhood to see that it was not their fault that they were being traumatized. When there was one witnessing adult who sufficiently decried what was being done to them, most did not develop such a ferocious, self-annihilating critic. Typically this was the other parent, an enlightened older sibling, a relative, a teacher or a kindly neighbor.  
  
我还注意到，在童年时期得到帮助，认识到他们遭受创伤不是他们自己的错的那部分幸存者之间存在显著差异。当有一个见证成年人对他们所遭受的一切表示足够的谴责时，大多数人并没有发展出如此凶猛、自我毁灭的批评家。通常这是另一个父母、一个开明的哥哥或姐姐、一个亲戚、一个老师或一个善良的邻居。
