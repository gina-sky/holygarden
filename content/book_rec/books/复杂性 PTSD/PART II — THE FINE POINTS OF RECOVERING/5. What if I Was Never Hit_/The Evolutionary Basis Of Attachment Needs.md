\*\*The Evolutionary Basis Of Attachment Needs

依恋需求的进化基础\*\*

The human brain evolved during the Hunter-Gatherer era that represents 99.8% of our time on this planet. For a child, safety from predators during these times depended on being in very close proximity to an adult. Even the briefest loss of contact with a parental figure could trigger panicky feelings as beasts of prey only needed seconds to snatch away an unprotected child.

人类的大脑在狩猎采集时代进化，这个时代占据了我们在地球上的 99.8%时间。对于孩子来说，在那个时代，远离捕食者的安全取决于他们与成人的紧密距离。即使与父母短暂失去联系也可能引发恐慌，因为捕食者只需几秒钟就能抓走一个无保护的孩子。

Fear hard-wired in the child as a healthy response to separation from a protective adult. Fear also linked automatically with the fight response so that the infant and toddler would automatically cry angrily for attention, help, and cessation of abandonment.

恐惧在孩子心中被编程为对与保护性成人分离的健康反应。恐惧也与战斗反应自动联系起来，所以婴儿和幼儿会自动愤怒地哭泣以引起注意、寻求帮助和停止被遗弃。

Cptsd-inducing families however loathe angry crying, and many can find professionals to back them up for routinely leaving babies and very young children to “cry it out” on their own.

然而，创伤后应激障碍诱导的家庭却厌恶愤怒的哭泣，许多家庭可以找到专业人士支持他们，让他们习惯性地将婴儿和非常年幼的孩子单独留下“哭出来”。

In most dysfunctional families, parents disdain children for needing any kind of help or attention at all. Moreover, even the most well-intentioned parent can seriously neglect their children by subscribing to the egregious 20th century “wisdom” that “Kids need quality time - quantity does not matter.”

在大多数功能失调的家庭中，父母对孩子需要任何形式的帮助或关注都感到厌恶。此外，即使是最有良好意图的父母也可能通过订阅 20 世纪令人震惊的“智慧”而严重忽视他们的孩子：“孩子们需要高质量的时间——数量并不重要。”

When children experience long periods of being powerless to obtain needed connection with a parent, they become increasingly anxious, upset and depressed. In Cptsd-engendering families, the absence of care and concern is extreme. A caretaker is rarely or never available for support, comfort or protection.

当孩子们经历长时间无法与父母建立所需联系的无能为力时，他们会变得越来越焦虑、不安和抑郁。在产生创伤后应激障碍的家庭中，缺乏关怀和关注是极端的。照顾者很少或永远无法提供支持、安慰或保护。

If this is what you suffered, you then grew up feeling that no one likes you. No one ever listened to you or seemed to want you around. No one had empathy for you, showed you warmth, or invited closeness. No one cared about what you thought, felt, did, wanted or dreamed of. You learned early that, no matter how hurt, alienated, or terrified you were, turning to a parent would do nothing more than exacerbate your experience of rejection.

如果你经历过这种情况，那么你长大后会觉得自己不受欢迎。没有人曾倾听过你，或似乎想要你待在身边。没有人对你表示同情，给予你温暖，或邀请你亲近。没有人关心你的想法、感受、行为、愿望或梦想。你很早就学会了，无论你受到多少伤害、感到多么被排斥或恐惧，向父母寻求帮助只会加剧你的被拒绝感。

[[null|]]When caretakers turn their backs on a child’s need for help and support, her inner world becomes an increasingly nightmarish amalgam of fear, shame and depression. The child who is abandoned in this way experiences the world as a terrifying place.

当照顾者对儿童寻求帮助和支持的需求置之不理时，她的内心世界变成了越来越可怕的噩梦般的混合体，充满了恐惧、羞愧和抑郁。被这样遗弃的孩子会将世界视为一个可怕的地方。

Over time the child’s dominant experience of herself is so replete with emotional pain and so unmanageable that that she has to dissociate, self-medicate, act out \[aggression against others\] or act in \[aggression against the self\] to distract from it.

随着时间的推移，孩子对自己占主导的经验充满了情感痛苦，难以控制，以至于她不得不分离自我，自我治疗，表现出对他人或对自己的攻击行为来分散注意力。

The situation of the abandoned child further deteriorates as an extended absence of warmth and protection gives rise to the cancerous growth of the inner critic as described above. The child projects his hope for being accepted onto self-perfection. By the time the child is becoming self-reflective, cognitions start to arise that sound like this: “I’m so despicable, worthless, unlovable, and ugly; maybe my parents would love me if I could make myself like those perfect kids I see on TV.”

被遗弃的孩子的情况进一步恶化，因为长期缺乏温暖和保护，导致上述描述的内在批评家的癌性生长。孩子将希望被接受的希望投射到自我完善上。当孩子开始自我反思时，开始出现这样的认知：“我如此卑鄙、毫无价值、不可爱、丑陋；也许如果我能让自己像我在电视上看到的那些完美孩子一样，我的父母就会爱我。”

In this way, the child becomes hyperaware of imperfections and strives to become flawless. Eventually she roots out the ultimate flaw – the mortal sin of wanting or asking for her parents’ time or energy. Intrinsic to this process is noticing – more and more hyper-vigilantly - how her parents turn their back or become angry or disgusted whenever she needs anything, whether it be attention, listening, interest, or affection.

通过这种方式，孩子变得对不完美极度敏感，并努力变得完美无瑕。最终，她找到了最终的缺陷——想要或请求父母的时间和精力的致命罪过。这个过程内在地包括注意到——越来越高度警觉地注意到——每当她需要任何东西时，无论是关注、倾听、兴趣还是爱，她的父母是如何转身、生气或厌恶的。

Emotional neglect, alone, causes children to abandon themselves, and to give up on the formation of a self. They do so to preserve an illusion of connection with the parent and to protect themselves from the danger of losing that tenuous connection. This typically requires a great deal of self-abdication, e.g., the forfeiture of self-esteem, self-confidence, self-care, self-interest, and self-protection.

情感忽视本身会导致孩子放弃自我，放弃形成自我。他们这样做是为了保持与父母的联系幻想，并保护自己免受失去这种脆弱联系的危险。这通常需要大量的自我放弃，例如，放弃自尊、自信、自我照顾、自我利益和自我保护。

Moreover, endangerment programs proliferate in the critic as the child learns that he cannot ask his parent to protect him from dangers and injustices in the outside world, never mind in the home. [[null|]]His only recourse is to become hypervigilant about things that can go wrong. His critic compiles lists of possible calamities, especially those that are graphically portrayed in the media.

此外，随着孩子意识到他无法要求父母保护他免受外界危险和不公正的侵害，更不用说在家中了，危险感在批评者中蔓延。他唯一的办法是过度警觉地关注可能出错的事情。他的批评者会列出可能发生的灾难清单，尤其是那些在媒体中被生动描绘的灾难。

The media gives the critic of the abandoned child much fodder to play with. She may be exposed daily to hours of programs that glorify sarcasm, backbiting and bullying. Moreover news programs, with a ninety percent content of bad news, fill her head with impressions that the world is predominantly hostile and dangerous. Even worse, emotionally neglectful parents commonly abandon their children to their favorite babysitter – the TV.

媒体为被遗弃孩子的批评者提供了大量素材。她可能每天都要接触到几个小时颂扬讽刺、说人坏话和欺凌的节目。此外，新闻节目，内容百分之九十是坏消息，让她的大脑充满了世界主要是敌对和危险的印象。更糟糕的是，情感忽视的父母通常把他们的孩子留给最喜欢的保姆——电视。

Through such neglect the child’s consciousness eventually becomes overwhelmed with the processes of _drasticizing_ and _catastrophizing_. Drasticizing and catastrophizing are critic processes that lead the child to constantly rehearse fearful scenarios in a vain attempt to prepare himself for the worst. This is the process by which Cptsd with its overdeveloped stress and toxic shame programs sets in and becomes triggerable by a plethora of normally innocuous stimuli.

通过这种忽视，孩子的意识最终被极端化和灾难化的过程所淹没。极端化和灾难化是批判性过程，使孩子不断排练恐惧场景，徒劳地试图为自己准备最坏的情况。这就是创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）及其过度发展的压力和有毒羞耻感程序开始并能够被大量通常无害的刺激触发的过程。

Most notable of these stimuli are other people, especially unknown people or people even vaguely reminiscent of the parents. Over time, the critic comes to assume that all other people are dangerous and automatically triggers the fight, flight, freeze or fawn response whenever a stranger or unproven other comes into view.

这些刺激中最显著的是其他人，尤其是陌生人或与父母有模糊相似之处的人。随着时间的推移，批评者开始认为所有其他人都很危险，并且每当一个陌生人或未经证实的人出现在视野中时，就会自动触发战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好反应。

This people-are-dangerous process typically devolves into the social anxiety that is frequently a symptom of Cptsd. In worst case scenarios it manifests as social phobia and agoraphobia. In my opinion, agoraphobia is rarely the fear of open spaces. It is instead a disguised form of social phobia. It is the fear of going out lest you run into someone or anyone.

这种“人是危险的”过程通常演变成社会焦虑，这通常是 Cptsd 的常见症状。在最糟糕的情况下，它表现为社交恐惧症和广场恐惧症。在我看来，广场恐惧症很少是对开阔空间的恐惧。相反，它是一种伪装的社会恐惧症。它是害怕外出以免遇到某人或任何人的恐惧。
