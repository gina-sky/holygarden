\*\*The Power Of Narrative

叙事的力量\*\*

There is also growing evidence that recovery from Complex PTSD is reflected in the narrative a person tells about her life. The degree of recovery matches the degree to which a survivor’s story is complete, coherent, and emotionally congruent and told from a self-sympathetic perspective.

还有越来越多的证据表明，从复杂 PTSD 中恢复的情况反映在一个人讲述她生活的叙事中。恢复的程度与幸存者的故事是否完整、连贯、情感上协调一致，以及是否从自我同情的角度讲述的程度相匹配。

In my experience, deep level recovery is often reflected in a narrative that highlights the role of emotional neglect in describing what one has suffered and what one continues to deal with.

在我的经验中，深层次的恢复往往反映在一种叙事中，这种叙事突出了情感忽视在描述一个人所遭受的以及一个人继续应对的事情中的作用。

[[null|]]My client, Matt, peeled a large layer off his onion of denial and minimization two days before Mother’s Day. He came into his session in a terrible flashback. “Life sucks and I suck even more. I couldn’t even do something as simple as pick out a Mother’s Day card.”

我的客户，马特，在母亲节前两天，从他的否认和最小化中剥去了一层。他带着可怕的回忆进入了他的咨询。 “生活很糟糕，我更糟糕。我甚至做不到像挑选一张母亲节卡片这样简单的事情。”

Fortunately, Matt had achieved a great deal of de-minimization since the previous Mother’s Day when he thought his mother was a good mother because she had never hit him. Now however, he was heavily triggered by spending an hour in a card shop unable to find a card that he could send to his mother. As we explored this further, we discovered that the sentiments written in every card made him feel like he would be betraying his inner child if he sent it.

幸运的是，自从上次母亲节时，他认为他的母亲是个好母亲，因为她从未打过他，马特已经取得了很大的去最小化成果。然而，现在他在一家卡片店花了一个小时，却找不到一张可以寄给母亲的卡片，这让他非常受刺激。当我们进一步探讨这个问题时，我们发现每张卡片上写的情感都让他觉得自己如果寄出去就会背叛自己的内心小孩。

“I tell you, Pete, not one of those cards describes something that I could be grateful for. I don’t have one memory of anything nice she ever said or did for me!” Before long, he was deep into grieving about how little mothering he had received from his mother.

“我告诉你，皮特，那些卡片中没有一张描述了我可以感激的事情。我连一件她为我做过的好事或说过的好话都没有！”不久，他开始深切地哀悼他从母亲那里得到的母爱是多么少。

He cried and angered about the scornful look and the sarcastic tone of voice that so characterized his interactions with her. “Why did I have to get such a bad deal from the mothering deck?!”

他哭泣和愤怒，因为他与她互动时总是带着轻蔑的眼神和讽刺的语气。“我为什么要在母爱牌中抽到这么糟糕的牌？！”

Towards the end of the session, as often happens with healthy grieving, he felt his flashback resolve and was restored to feeling like he was once again on his own side. The relief of being out of the flashback also allowed his healthy sense of humor to return.

在会议快结束时，就像健康哀悼时常发生的那样，他感到自己的闪回逐渐消解，并恢复了曾经属于自己的感觉。摆脱闪回的释然也让他那健康的幽默感回归。

He started riffing: “I’m going to start a greeting card business for people like me. I’m going to make a line of cards for people with dysfunctional mothers. How about this? ‘Thanks Mom for never knowing what grade I was in’; or ‘Thanks Mom for all the memories of you walking away whenever I was hurting’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to only notice what was wrong me’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to frown at myself in self-disgust.’”

他开始即兴发挥：“我要为像我这样的人开一家贺卡店。我要为有功能失调的母亲的人制作一系列贺卡。怎么样？‘感谢妈妈，你从未知道我在哪个年级’；或者‘感谢妈妈，你在我受伤时总是离开’；或者‘感谢妈妈，你教我如何只注意到自己的错误’；或者‘感谢妈妈，你教我如何对自己皱眉，感到自我厌恶。’”

[[null|]]Understanding how profoundly derelict your parents were in their duty to nurture and protect you is a master key to your recovery. You will benefit greatly from seeing emotional flashbacks as direct messages from your child-self about how much your parents rejected you. When denial is significantly deconstructed, you will typically feel genuine compassion for the child that you were. This self-compassion assuages emotional neglect by providing you with the missed childhood experience of receiving empathy in painful emotional states instead of contempt or abandonment. This, then, helps you to reverse the childhood-survival habit of automatic self-abandonment. In turn, this can further motivate you to identify and address the many ways you were abused and/or neglected. [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|Chapter 8]] of my book, _The Tao of Fully Feeling,_ provides detailed guidelines for assessing and remediating your abuse/neglect picture.

理解你父母在养育和保护你方面的极度失职，是恢复你的关键。当你将情感闪回视为来自你孩子自我的直接信息，了解父母对你有多大的排斥时，你会受益匪浅。当否认被显著解构时，你通常会对你曾经的孩子产生真正的同情。这种自我同情通过在你痛苦的情感状态下提供缺失的童年经历——得到同情而不是轻蔑或遗弃——来缓解情感忽视。这有助于你逆转童年生存习惯中的自动自我放弃。反过来，这可以进一步激励你识别和解决你遭受的虐待和/或忽视的许多方式。我的书《全然感受的道》第八章提供了评估和修复你的虐待/忽视情况的详细指南。

Finally, it is an empowering accomplishment to really get the profound significance of childhood emotional neglect. It is often flashback-resolving to realize in the moment that a flashback into bewilderment and hopelessness is an emotional reliving of your childhood trauma. Like nothing else, this can generate a self-protective impulse toward your child-self and your present-time self, kick-starting the process of resolving any given flashback.

最后，真正理解童年情感忽视的深刻意义是一种赋权的成就。在当下意识到，一次陷入困惑和无助的闪回是对你童年创伤的情感重演。没有什么比这更能激发出一种自我保护的冲动，针对你的孩童自我和现在的自我，从而启动解决任何给定闪回的过程。
