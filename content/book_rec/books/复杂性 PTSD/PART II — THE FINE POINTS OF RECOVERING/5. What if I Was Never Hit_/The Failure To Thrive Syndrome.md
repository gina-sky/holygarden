\*\*The Failure To Thrive Syndrome

成长失败综合症\*\*

When a child is continuously deprived of a nurturing caretaker, love-starvation steadily increases and sometimes devolves into the Failure to Thrive Syndrome.

当一个孩子持续缺乏一个有爱心的照顾者时，爱的饥渴会稳步增加，有时甚至会恶化成成长失败综合症。

_Failure to thrive_ is a term coined in the mid twentieth century to describe the epidemic of baby deaths that occurred when new germ-phobic practices were introduced into hospitals. The new standard was that nurses were prohibited from holding babies for fear of contaminating them. Infant mortality immediately began to climb.

成长失败是一个在 20 世纪中叶创造的术语，用来描述当新的细菌恐惧症实践被引入医院时发生的婴儿死亡流行病。新的标准是护士被禁止抱婴儿，以防污染他们。婴儿死亡率立即开始上升。

Modern medical practice has abandoned this heartless approach because of the _Failure to thrive_ research. This research has since been corroborated by data from Eastern European orphanages where there are insufficient staff to meet the _contact-comfort needs_ of babies. Modern medicine now accepts as scientific fact the principle that babies need a great deal of physical touch and nurturing in order to thrive.

现代医学实践因“成长失败”研究而放弃了这种无情的做法。这项研究随后得到了来自东欧孤儿院的数据证实，这些孤儿院人员不足，无法满足婴儿的接触舒适需求。现代医学现在将婴儿需要大量身体接触和养育以茁壮成长的原则视为科学事实。

In my experience, failure to thrive is not an all-or-none phenomenon, but rather a continuum that stretches from the abandonment depression to death. Many Cptsd survivors never thrived as babies. I believe that many suffered painful bouts of lingering near the end of the continuum that feels death-like. Several of my clients commonly have quipped that they “feel like death warmed over” when they are in a flashback.

在我的经验中，成长失败并非全有或全无的现象，而是一种从放弃抑郁到死亡的连续体。许多 Cptsd 幸存者从未在婴儿时期茁壮成长。我相信他们中许多人经历了在连续体末端的痛苦挣扎，那种感觉就像死亡。我的几位客户经常开玩笑说，当他们陷入闪回时，感觉就像“死而复生”。

Moreover, I suspect that some traumatized children do die from their abandonment. Perhaps, their immune systems weaken and make them more susceptible to diseases. Perhaps, as David Kalshed hints, they unconsciously gravitate toward lethal “accidents” to terminate their misery.

此外，我怀疑一些受创伤的儿童会因被遗弃而死亡。也许，他们的免疫系统变弱，使他们更容易受到疾病的侵袭。也许，正如大卫·卡尔舍德暗示的那样，他们无意识地被致命的“意外”所吸引，以结束他们的痛苦。

She was hit by a truck and it took months of hospitalization to save her leg. Her most tearful re-experiencing of this event was remembering how she woke up in the hospital and felt tremendous disappointment that she was still alive.

我的一个客户在处理她被困在回忆中的时候，向我报告了这段痛苦的回忆。她当时十岁，处于迷茫状态，走到两辆停着的车之间，进入了交通中。她被一辆卡车撞到，需要几个月的住院治疗才能保住她的腿。她最感伤的回忆是想起她在医院醒来，感到巨大的失望，因为她还活着。
