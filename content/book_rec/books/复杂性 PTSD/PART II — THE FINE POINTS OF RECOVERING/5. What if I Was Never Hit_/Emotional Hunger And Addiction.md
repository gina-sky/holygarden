**Emotional Hunger And Addiction  
  
情感饥饿与成瘾**

The emotional hunger that comes from parental abandonment often morphs over time into an insatiable appetite for substances and/or addictive processes. Minimization of early abandonment often transforms later in life into the minimizing that some survivors use to rationalize their substance and process addictions. Fortunately, many survivors eventually come to see their substance or process addictions as problematic. But many also minimize the deleterious effects of their addiction and jokingly dismiss their need to end or reduce their reliance on them.  
  
来自父母遗弃的情感饥饿随着时间的推移往往会变成对物质和/或成瘾过程的无法满足的渴望。早期遗弃的轻视往往会在成年后转变为一些幸存者用来合理化他们物质和过程成瘾的轻视。幸运的是，许多幸存者最终会认识到他们的物质或过程成瘾是有问题的。但许多人也轻视了他们成瘾的破坏性影响，并开玩笑地否认他们结束或减少对这些事物的依赖的需要。

When the survivor has no understanding of the effects of trauma or no memory of being traumatized, addictions are often understandable, misplaced attempts to regulate painful emotional flashbacks. However many survivors are now in a position to see how self-destructive their addictions are. They are now old enough to learn healthier ways of self-soothing.  
  
当幸存者不了解创伤的影响或没有受到创伤的记忆时，上瘾往往是理解中的、定位不当的试图调节痛苦的情感闪回。然而，现在许多幸存者已经处于能够看到他们的上瘾是如何自我毁灭的位置。他们现在已经足够成熟，可以学习更健康的方式来自我安抚。

Accordingly, substance and process addictions can be seen as misguided attempts to distract from inner pain. The desire to reduce such habits can therefore be used as motivation to learn the more sophisticated forms of self-soothing that Cptsd recovery work has to offer.  
  
因此，物质和过程成瘾可以被视为试图转移内心痛苦的错误尝试。因此，减少这种习惯的愿望可以用作动力，去学习 Cptsd 康复工作提供的更高级的自我安抚形式。

As we will see in [[11. Grieving|chapter 11]], grieving work offers us irreplaceable tools for working through inner pain. This then helps obviate the need to harmfully distract ourselves from our pain.  
  
正如我们在第 11 章中将会看到的，哀悼工作为我们处理内心痛苦提供了不可替代的工具。这有助于消除我们有害地分散注意力以逃避痛苦的需要。
