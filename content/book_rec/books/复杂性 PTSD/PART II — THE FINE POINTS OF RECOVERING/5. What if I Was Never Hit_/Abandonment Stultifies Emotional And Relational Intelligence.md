\*\*Abandonment Stultifies Emotional And Relational Intelligence

被遗弃阻碍了情感和关系智力的发展\*\*

As stated above, emotionally abandoned children often devolve into experiencing all people as dangerous, no matter how benign [[null|]]or generous they may in fact be. Even love, coming their way, reverberates threateningly on a subliminal level. Unconsciously, they fear that if they momentarily “trick” someone into liking them, the forbidden prize will vanish once their social perfectionism inevitably fails and exposes their unworthiness. Moreover, when this occurs, they will be triggered even more deeply into the abandonment mélange.

如上所述，情感被遗弃的孩子往往将所有人视为危险，无论他们实际上可能多么善良或慷慨。即使是到来的爱，在潜意识层面上也会产生威胁性的回响。他们无意识地害怕，如果他们暂时“欺骗”某人喜欢他们，一旦他们的社会完美主义不可避免地失败并暴露出他们的不值得，禁止的奖品就会消失。此外，当这种情况发生时，他们将被更深入地触发到遗弃的混合状态。

Emotional intelligence and its cohort, relational intelligence, are forced into developmental arrest by abandoning parents. Children never learn that a relationship with a healthy person can be comforting and enriching. The ability to open to and benefit from love and caring from others often lays dormant and undeveloped.

情感智力和其同伴关系智力被遗弃的父母迫停止发展。孩子们从未学会与一个健康的人建立的关系可以带来安慰和丰富。从他人的爱和关怀中开放并从中受益的能力往往处于潜伏和未开发状态。

Moreover, the appropriate management of the normal emotions that recurrently arise in significant relationships is never modeled for them. Emotional intelligence about the healthy and functional aspects of anger, sadness, and fear lies fallow.

此外，他们从未被示范如何适当管理在重要关系中反复出现的正常情绪。关于愤怒、悲伤和恐惧的健康和功能方面的情感智力处于休眠状态。
