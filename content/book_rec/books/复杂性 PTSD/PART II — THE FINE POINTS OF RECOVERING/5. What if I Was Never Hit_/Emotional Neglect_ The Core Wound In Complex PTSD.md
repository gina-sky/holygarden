\*\*Emotional Neglect: The Core Wound In Complex PTSD

情感忽视：复杂 PTSD 的核心创伤\*\*

Minimization about the damage caused by extensive emotional neglect is at the core of the Cptsd denial onion. Our journey of recovering takes a quantum leap when we really feel and understand how devastating it was to be emotionally abandoned. An absence of parental loving interest and engagement, especially in the first few years, creates an overwhelming emptiness. Life feels harrowingly frightening to the infant or toddler who is left for long periods without comfort and care. Children are helpless and powerless for a long time, and when they sense that no one has their back, they feel scared, miserable and disheartened. Much of the constant anxiety that adult survivors live in is this still aching fear that comes from having been so frighteningly abandoned.

关于广泛情感忽视所造成损害的淡化是 Cptsd 否认洋葱的核心。当我们真正感受到并理解情感被遗弃的破坏性时，我们的康复之旅就迈出了巨大的飞跃。缺乏父母的关爱兴趣和参与，尤其是在最初的几年，会创造出一种压倒性的空虚。对于长时间没有安慰和照顾而被留下的婴儿或幼儿来说，生活感觉令人恐惧。孩子们长期处于无助和无力的状态，当他们感觉到没有人支持他们时，他们会感到害怕、痛苦和沮丧。成年幸存者所经历的持续焦虑中很大一部分仍然是一种来自被如此可怕地遗弃的仍然疼痛的恐惧。

Many survivors never discover and work through the wounds that correlate with this level. This happens because they over-assign their suffering to overt abuse and never get to the core issue of their emotional abandonment. As stated above, this is especially likely to occur with survivors who dismissively compare their trauma to those who were abused more noticeably and more dramatically. I find this painfully ironic because some people suffer significant active abuse without developing Cptsd. Typically, they are “spared” because there is one caretaker who does not emotionally neglect them.

许多幸存者从未发现并处理与这一层级相关的创伤。这是因为他们将痛苦过度归咎于明显的虐待，而从未触及他们情感被遗弃的核心问题。如上所述，这种情况在那些轻视地将自己的创伤与那些受到更明显和更剧烈虐待的人相比较的幸存者中尤为常见。我发现这令人痛苦地讽刺，因为有些人遭受了严重的积极虐待，却没有发展出创伤后应激障碍。通常，他们“幸免于难”，因为有一位照顾者没有情感忽视他们。

Traumatic emotional neglect occurs when a child does not have a single caretaker to whom she can turn in times of need or danger. Cptsd then sets in to the degree that there is no alternative adult \[relative, older sibling, neighbor, or teacher\] to turn to for comfort and protection. This is especially true when the abandonment occurs 24/7, 365 days a year for the first few years.

创伤性情感忽视发生在孩子没有一位在需要或危险时可以寻求帮助的照顾者时。创伤后应激障碍就会随之产生，程度取决于没有其他成人（亲戚、年长的兄弟姐妹、邻居或老师）可以寻求安慰和保护。这种情况在最初几年中，每天 24 小时，每年 365 天都发生时尤为如此。

Growing up emotionally neglected is like nearly dying of thirst outside the fenced off fountain of a parent’s warmth and interest. Emotional neglect makes children feel worthless, unlovable and [[null|]]excruciatingly empty. It leaves them with a hunger that gnaws deeply at the center of their being. They starve for human warmth and comfort.

在情感上被忽视的长大就像在父母温暖和兴趣的围栏外几乎渴死。情感忽视让孩子们感到毫无价值、不可爱，以及痛苦地空虚。它让他们心中留下一种饥饿，深深地啃噬着他们的存在。他们渴望人类的温暖和安慰。
