WHAT IF I WAS NEVER HIT?  
  
如果我从未被打过呢？

Physical and sexual abuse are the most obvious traumas that a child can experience, especially when they are ongoing. However, much that is also traumatic goes unnoticed in Cptsd-engendering families. This often occurs because parental acts of physical abuse are more blatant than acts of verbal and emotional abuse and neglect. It appears to me that just as many children acquire Cptsd from emotionally traumatizing families as from physically traumatizing ones.  
  
身体和性虐待是儿童可能经历的最明显的创伤，尤其是在这些创伤持续发生时。然而，在导致创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的家庭中，许多创伤往往被忽视。这通常是因为父母的行为虐待比言语、情感虐待和忽视更为明显。在我看来，从情感创伤家庭中获得的创伤后应激障碍与从身体创伤家庭中获得的创伤后应激障碍一样多。

Denial about the traumatic effects of childhood abandonment can seriously hamper your ability to recover. In childhood, ongoing emotional neglect typically creates overwhelming feelings of fear, shame and emptiness. As an adult survivor, you may continuously flashback into this abandonment mélange. Recovering depends on realizing that fear, shame and depression are the lingering effects of a loveless childhood. Without such understanding, your crucial, unmet needs for comforting human connection can strand you in a great deal of unnecessary suffering.  
  
否认童年被遗弃的创伤影响会严重阻碍你的康复能力。在童年时期，持续的情感忽视通常会产生压倒性的恐惧、羞耻和空虚感。作为成年幸存者，你可能会不断地闪回这种被遗弃的混合感。康复取决于意识到恐惧、羞耻和抑郁是缺乏爱的童年的持久影响。没有这种理解，你关键的未满足的需求——寻求安慰性的人性联系——可能会让你陷入大量的不必要的痛苦中。
