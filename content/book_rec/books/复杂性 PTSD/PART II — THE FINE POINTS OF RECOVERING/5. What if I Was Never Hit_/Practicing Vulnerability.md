**Practicing Vulnerability  
  
练习脆弱**

Emotional abandonment is healed by the type of real intimacy that we have been discussing. And once again real intimacy depends on us showing up in times of vulnerability. Deep-level recovering occurs when we successfully connect with a safe enough other during the flashbacked-times of feeling trapped in the fear, shame and depression of the abandonment mélange.  
  
情感遗弃通过我们所讨论的真实亲密关系得到治愈。而真实的亲密关系取决于我们在脆弱时刻的出现。当我们成功与一个足够安全的人建立联系，在回忆起被困在遗弃的恐惧、羞耻和抑郁中时，就会发生深层次的恢复。

In this vein, I had to painstakingly practice showing up in my pain for years. At first I could only do this infrequently. I was too [[null|]]habituated to my childhood default positions of hiding or camouflaging with substances whenever I was in the grip of the abandonment mélange. Yet I drew strength to increase my practice from a growing distaste for the social perfectionism of my people-pleasing codependence. I somehow knew my loneliness would never decrease unless I took the risk to see if certain well chosen others would accept me in all aspects of my experience, not just the shiny ones.  
  
在这条路上，我不得不痛苦地练习在痛苦中现身多年。起初我只能偶尔做到。我太习惯于在感到被遗弃时，用隐藏或用物质来伪装我的童年默认位置。然而，我从对取悦他人代码依存中社会完美主义的日益厌恶中汲取力量，增加我的练习。我似乎知道，除非我冒险看看是否某些精心挑选的人会接受我经历的所有方面，而不仅仅是光鲜的一面，否则我的孤独感永远不会减少。

And of course, like most survivors, I was ignorant at first that I was even experiencing the emotional pain of the abandonment mélange. How could I help but conceal it?  
  
当然，像大多数幸存者一样，起初我并不知道自己在经历被遗弃的混合情感痛苦。我怎能不隐藏它呢？

Moreover, even after considerable de-minimization of my childhood abuse/neglect picture, I was still convinced that everyone but my therapist would find me abhorrent if I shared about my flashback feelings. Furthermore, my trust of my therapist also wavered quite a bit at first, especially during my deepest flashbacks.  
  
此外，即使我对童年虐待/忽视的描述进行了相当程度的简化，我仍然确信除了我的治疗师外，其他人如果知道我关于闪回的感受，都会觉得我令人厌恶。此外，一开始我对治疗师的信任也动摇了不少，尤其是在我最深层次的闪回期间。

Gratefully, sufficient positive experiences with my therapist eventually emboldened me to bring my authentic vulnerability to other select and gradually proven relationships, where I found the acceptance, safety and support that, previously, I would not have known to wish for.  
  
感谢我的治疗师，与他们的足够积极的经历最终让我鼓起勇气，将我的真实脆弱带到其他一些精选且逐渐证明的关系中，在那里我找到了之前不知道自己会渴望的接纳、安全和支持。

There are limitations of the analogy of the onion. Later recovery does typically involve working at various levels at the same time. De-minimization is a lifetime process. Revisiting a central issue of our abandonment picture sometimes impacts us even more deeply than it did at first.  
  
洋葱的比喻也有其局限性。后续的恢复通常需要在同一时间处理多个层面。简化是一个终身的过程。重新审视我们被遗弃的核心问题有时甚至比最初更深刻地影响我们。

One such occasion left me reeling with the certain knowledge that getting hit felt preferable to being abandoned for long hours outside my depressed mother’s locked bedroom door. I would pound on the door even though I knew she would explode because [[null|]]I just could not bear the isolation. I have known about the latter for quite some time now and yet writing about it brings up some new bitter-sweet tears.  
  
这样的一次经历让我感到头晕目眩，确信被打击的感觉比被遗弃在抑郁的母亲锁着的卧室门外几个小时要好。即使我知道她会爆发，我还是会猛敲门，因为我无法忍受孤独。我已经知道后者很久了，但写下来还是会引起一些苦乐参半的泪水。

Bitter-sweet tears are not uncommon in the ongoing work of peeling the layers of the denial onion. The tears are bitter because we realize the abandonment was even more devastating than we previously realized. And then the tears are sweet because they validate the truth of the recollection and put the blame where it truly belongs. And then they may be bitter again because the horrible abandonments happened over and over again when we were so young and legitimately needed so much help. And then they can turn sweet again, as in tears of gratitude, because a person often comes through this kind of depth work with an enhanced compassion for what she suffered and a healthy pride about having survived.  
  
在剥去否认洋葱的层层外皮的过程中，苦乐参半的泪水并不罕见。泪水是苦的，因为我们意识到被遗弃的打击比我们之前想象的还要严重。然后泪水又变得甜了，因为它们验证了回忆的真实性，将责任归咎于真正的地方。然后它们可能再次变得苦涩，因为当我们还很小，真正需要帮助的时候，可怕的遗弃一次又一次地发生。然后它们可以再次变得甜蜜，就像感激的泪水一样，因为一个人往往会在这种深度工作中对所受的苦难有更深的同情，并对幸存下来感到健康的自豪。

In my latest experience of this type of grieving my sweet tears came from realizing that I do regularly experience good enough love and safety in relationship. And then my tears were bitter again because I can still emotionally flashback to that bereft state of feeling stranded from the comfort of others, even occasionally from my wife and son. And then my tears were sweet again because my flashbacks are so much easier to handle these days, especially as I increasingly master the use of the tools I describe in [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]].  
  
在我最近的一次这种悲伤体验中，我甜蜜的泪水来自于意识到我确实在关系中经常体验到足够的爱和安全。然后我的泪水再次变得苦涩，因为我仍然可以情感上回想起那种从他人的安慰中感到孤立无援的状态，甚至偶尔是从我的妻子和儿子那里。然后我的泪水再次变得甜蜜，因为我的回放现在更容易处理了，尤其是在我越来越熟练地使用我在第 8 章中描述的工具。
