**Theoretical Neurobiology Of The Critic  
  
批评者的理论神经生物学**

Unrelenting criticism, especially when it is ground in with parental rage and scorn, is so injurious that it changes the structure of the child’s brain.  
  
持续的批评，尤其是当它与父母的愤怒和轻蔑相结合时，伤害如此之大，以至于它改变了孩子的大脑结构。

Repeated messages of disdain are internalized and adopted by the child, who eventually repeats them over and over to himself. Incessant repetitions result in the construction of thick neural pathways of self-hate and self-disgust. Over time a self-hate response attaches to more and more of the child’s thoughts, feelings and behaviors.  
  
反复的轻蔑信息被孩子内化并采纳，最终他一遍又一遍地对自己重复这些话。不断的重复导致构建了厚重的自我仇恨和自我厌恶的神经通路。随着时间的推移，自我仇恨的反应附着在孩子越来越多的想法、感受和行为上。

Eventually, any inclination toward authentic or vulnerable self-expression activates internal neural networks of self-loathing. The child is forced to exist in a crippling state of self-attack, which eventually becomes the equivalent of full-fledged self-abandonment. The ability to support himself or take his own side in any way is decimated.  
  
最终，任何倾向于真实或脆弱的自我表达都会激活自我厌恶的内部神经网络。孩子被迫存在于一种令人残疾的自我攻击状态中，这最终等同于彻底的自我放弃。他支持自己或以任何方式站在自己一边的能力被彻底摧毁。

With ongoing parental reinforcement, these neural pathways expand into a large complex network that becomes an Inner Critic [[null|]]that dominates mental activity. The inner critic’s negative perspective creates many programs of self-rejecting perfectionism. At the same time, it obsesses about danger and catastrophizes incessantly. [[9. Shrinking the Inner Critic|Chapters 9]] and [^10] expand on shrinking and deconstructing these life-ruining programs. Until this is accomplished, the survivor typically lives in varying degrees of emotional flashback much of the time.  
  
随着持续的家长强化，这些神经通路扩展成一个庞大的复杂网络，成为主导心理活动的内在批评家。内在批评家的负面观点创造了许多自我拒绝的完美主义程序。同时，它对危险着迷，不断灾难化。第 9 章和第 10 章详细阐述了缩小和分解这些毁灭生活的程序。直到完成这一任务，幸存者通常大部分时间都生活在不同程度的精神闪回中。

The verbal and emotional layer of the abuse onion has many sub-layers of minimization. I have heard clients jokingly repeat numerous versions of this over and over: “I know I’m hard on myself, but if I don’t constantly kick my own ass, I’ll be more of a loser than I already am. In fact, I really need you to come down on me if I try to get away with anything!” A childhood rife with verbal and emotional abuse forces the child to so thoroughly identify with the critic, that it is as if the critic is his whole identity.  
  
虐待洋葱的语言和情感层面有许多最小化的子层。我听到客户们开玩笑地反复重复这个版本：“我知道我对自己的要求很严格，但如果我不一直踢自己的屁股，我就会比现在更失败。事实上，如果我试图逃避责任，我真的需要你对我严厉！”充满语言和情感虐待的童年迫使孩子与批评家完全认同，以至于批评家似乎就是他的整个身份。

Disidentification from the critic is the fight of a lifetime. To liberate your identity from the toxic critic, you will have to repetitively confront it for a long time. You will have greater success if you are prepared to forgive yourself for repeatedly collapsing back into the old habit of self-blame. Progress is always a gradual back and forth process. Ironically, a pernicious type of self-hate can constellate around the self-judgment that one is especially defective because she cannot simply banish the critic. This is the typical toxic, all-or-none thinking of the critic.  
  
与批评者的去认同是一生之斗。要解放你的身份，摆脱有毒的批评者，你将不得不长时间反复地与之对抗。如果你愿意原谅自己反复陷入自我责备的旧习惯，你将取得更大的成功。进步总是逐渐的往返过程。讽刺的是，一种有害的自我仇恨可以围绕一个人因为无法简单驱逐批评者而特别有缺陷的自我评判而形成。这是批评者的典型有毒的全有或全无的思维。

Sadly, many survivors give up on fighting the critic before recognizing the myriad subtle ways it tortures them. Yet, there is no more noble recovery battle than that which gradually frees the psyche from critic dominance. Until this happens to a significant degree, there is minimal development of the healthy, user-friendly ego.  
  
遗憾的是，许多幸存者在认识到它以无数微妙的方式折磨他们之前就放弃了与批评者的斗争。然而，没有比逐渐从批评者的统治中解放心理更崇高的恢复之战了。直到这种情况发生到一定程度，健康的、用户友好的自我才能得到最小程度的发展。

Let us look now at how emotional neglect alone can create a psyche-dominating critic.  
  
现在让我们看看仅仅情感忽视如何能创造一个主导心理的批评者。
