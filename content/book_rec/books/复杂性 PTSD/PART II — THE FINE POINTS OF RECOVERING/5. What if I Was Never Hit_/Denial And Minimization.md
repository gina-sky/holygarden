\*\*Denial And Minimization

否认和轻视\*\*

Confronting denial is no small task. Children so need to believe that their parents love and care for them, that they will deny and minimize away evidence of the most egregious neglect and abuse.

面对否认并非易事。孩子们如此需要相信他们的父母爱他们并关心他们，以至于他们会否认并最小化最严重的忽视和虐待的证据。

_De-minimization_ is a crucial aspect of confronting denial. It is the process by which a person deconstructs the defense of “making light” of his childhood trauma. The lifelong process of de-minimizing the impact of childhood trauma is like peeling a very slippery and caustic onion. The outer layer for some is the stark physical evidence of abuse, e.g., sexual abuse or excessive corporal punishment. Subsequent layers involve verbal, spiritual and emotional abuse. _Core_ layers have to do with verbal, spiritual and emotional neglect.

最小化是面对否认的关键方面。这是一个过程，一个人通过这个过程解构了“轻描淡写”他童年创伤的防御。最小化童年创伤影响的终身过程就像剥一个非常滑和腐蚀性的洋葱。对于一些人来说，外层是虐待的明显物理证据，例如性虐待或过度体罚。随后的层次包括言语、精神和情感虐待。核心层次与言语、精神和情感忽视有关。

In a perversely ironic way, my parents’ physical abuse of me was a blessing, for it was so blatant that my attempts to suppress, rationalize, make light of and laugh it off lost their power in adolescence, and I was able to see my father for the bully that he was. \[Seeing my idealized mother’s abusiveness came much later\].

以一种荒谬讽刺的方式，我父母对我进行的身体虐待是一种祝福，因为它是如此明显，以至于我在青春期试图压制、合理化、轻描淡写和一笑置之的努力失去了效力，我能够看到我的父亲是一个欺凌者。\[看到我理想化的母亲的虐待行为来得要晚得多\]。

Identifying my father’s behavior as abusive eventually helped me become aware of less blatant aspects of my parents’ oppression, and I subsequently discovered the verbal and emotional abuse layer of the onion of my childhood abandonment.

将我父亲的行为识别为虐待行为，最终帮助我意识到我父母压迫中不那么明显的方面，随后我发现了我童年被遗弃的洋葱层中的言语和情感虐待层面。
