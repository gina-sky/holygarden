\*\*Verbal And Emotional Abuse.

言语和情感虐待。\*\*

The fact that verbal and emotional abuse can be traumatic is lost on many childhood trauma victims, though it is rarely lost on recovering victims of cult brainwashing who also are prone to developing Cptsd.

言语和情感虐待可能造成创伤的事实，对许多童年创伤受害者来说并不明显，尽管这对那些也容易发展出 Cptsd 的、从邪教洗脑中恢复过来的受害者来说却很少是未知的。

Many survivors of verbal and emotional abuse never learn to validate its soul-damaging effects. They never accurately assign current time suffering to it. Attempts to acknowledge it are typically blindsided with thoughts that it was nothing compared to kids [[null|]]who were repeatedly beaten – who “had it so much worse.” As a child, I minimized my father’s frequent face-slapping by comparing it to my friend’s father who used to punch him.

许多言语和情感虐待的幸存者从未学会验证其灵魂破坏性影响。他们从未准确地将当前时间的痛苦归因于它。试图承认它的尝试通常会被这样的想法所蒙蔽，即它和那些反复被打的孩子相比微不足道——他们“遭受了更多的苦难。”作为一个孩子，我通过将我父亲频繁的脸颊打巴掌与我朋友父亲曾经打他的行为相比较，来最小化我父亲的这种行为。

Much later, however, I finally realized that for me, and many of my clients, verbal and emotional abuse damaged us much more than our physical abuse.

然而，很久以后，我终于意识到，对我来说，以及我的许多客户，言语和情感虐待对我们造成的伤害远超过身体虐待。

Ongoing assault with critical words systematically destroys our self-esteem and replaces it with a toxic inner critic that incessantly judges us as defective. Even worse, words that are emotionally poisoned with contempt infuse the child with fear and toxic shame. Fear and shame condition him to refrain from asking for attention, from expressing himself in ways that draw attention. Before long, he learns to refrain from seeking any kind of help or connection at all.

持续的批评，通过系统性地摧毁我们的自尊，用一种不断评判我们为缺陷的毒性内在批评者来取代，对我们的伤害极大。更糟糕的是，带有轻蔑情感毒化的言语，使孩子充满了恐惧和有毒的羞耻感。恐惧和羞耻感使他避免寻求关注，避免以吸引注意力的方式表达自己。不久，他就学会了避免寻求任何形式的帮助或联系。
