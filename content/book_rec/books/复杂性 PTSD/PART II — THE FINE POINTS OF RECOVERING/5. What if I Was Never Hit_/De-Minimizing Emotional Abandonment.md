\*\*De-Minimizing Emotional Abandonment

减少情感遗弃的影响\*\*

As with physical abuse, effective work on the wounds of verbal and emotional abuse can sometimes open the door to de-minimizing the awful impact of emotional neglect. I sometimes feel the most for my clients who were “only” neglected, because it is so difficult to see neglect as hard core evidence. Most people remember little before they were four years old. And by that time, much of this kind of damage is done. It typically takes some very deep introspective work, to realize that current time flashback pain is a re-creation of how bad it felt to be emotionally abandoned.

与身体虐待一样，有效处理言语和情感虐待的创伤有时会打开大门，淡化情感忽视的可怕影响。我有时最同情那些“仅仅”被忽视的客户，因为很难将忽视视为确凿的证据。大多数人四岁之前记得的很少。到那时，这种伤害已经造成了。通常需要非常深入的自我反省，才能意识到当前时间的闪回痛苦是对情感被遗弃时感觉有多糟糕的重现。

The remembering and de-minimizing of the impact of emotional neglect can take a long time. It is typically an intuitive piecing together of a lot of clues. The puzzle is often solved when a critical mass of childhood reconstruction is reached. Sometimes this fosters an epiphany that neglect is indeed at the core of present [[null|]]time suffering. Sometimes this epiphany brings a great relieving certainty that fragile self-esteem, frequent flashbacks, and recurring reenactments of unsupportive relationships were caused by the closed hearts of your parents.

记住和淡化情感忽视的影响可能需要很长时间。这通常是一系列线索的直观拼凑。当达到童年重建的关键质量时，谜团通常得以解开。有时这会激发一个顿悟，即忽视确实是当前时间痛苦的根源。有时这种顿悟会带来一种极大的安慰，确信脆弱的自尊、频繁的闪回和反复上演的不支持关系都是由于父母关闭的心扉造成的。

I sometimes regret that I did not know what I now know about this kind of neglect when I wrote my first book. I wish I had not over-focused on the role of abuse in my childhood trauma. It is so hard to convey this to a client whose critic minimizes and shames them for their plight by comparing them unfavorably to me: “I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad as you. My mother never hit me!”

我有时后悔在我写第一本书的时候，不知道我现在所知道的关于这种忽视的事情。我希望我没有过分关注我在童年创伤中遭受的虐待的角色。向一个客户传达这一点是如此困难，因为他们的批评者通过将他们与我作不利的比较来贬低和羞辱他们的困境：“我受的苦远没有你那么严重。我的母亲从没打过我！”

How ironic that this typically invokes a feeling-sense in me that the worst thing that happened to me, by far, was growing up so emotionally abandoned. In fact, it was not until I learned to assign the pain of numerous current time emotional flashbacks to the abject loneliness of my childhood, that I was able to work effectively on the repetition compulsion that lead me into so many neglectful relationships.

多么讽刺，这通常唤起我的一种感觉，那就是我经历过的最糟糕的事情，莫过于在情感上被彻底遗弃。事实上，直到我学会了将无数当前时间情感闪回的痛苦归咎于我童年时的极端孤独，我才能有效地处理那些导致我陷入许多忽视关系的重复冲动。

And once again this is not to deny or minimize the C-ptsd-inducing traumatization that does come from each and every type of abuse; physical, sexual, verbal and emotional.

再次强调，这并不是否认或贬低来自每种类型虐待的 C-ptsd 诱导的创伤；身体、性、言语和情感。
