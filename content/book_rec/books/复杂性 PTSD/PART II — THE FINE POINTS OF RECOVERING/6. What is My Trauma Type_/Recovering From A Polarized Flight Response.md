\*\*Recovering From A Polarized Flight Response

从极端飞行反应中恢复\*\*

The flight types that I have worked with are so busy trying to stay one step ahead of their pain that introspecting out loud in the therapy hour is the only time they find for self-examination. Learning about the 4F model often helps them to renounce the perfectionistic demands of the inner critic.

我合作过的飞行类型的人总是忙于试图领先一步摆脱痛苦，在治疗时段大声内省是他们唯一找到的自我检查时间。了解 4F 模型通常帮助他们放弃内心批评者的完美主义要求。

[[null|]]I gently and repetitively focus on confronting their denial and minimization about the costs of perfectionism. This is especially important with workaholics who often admit their addiction but secretly hold onto it as a badge of pride and superiority.

我温和而反复地关注他们关于完美主义代价的否认和轻视。这对于那些经常承认自己的上瘾，但秘密中将它视为骄傲和优越的标志的工作狂来说尤为重要。

Flight types can get “stuck in their head” by being over-analytical. Once a critical mass of understanding Cptsd is achieved, it is crucial for them to start moving into their feelings. Sooner or later, they must deepen their work by grieving about their childhood losses.

飞行类型的人可能会因为过度分析而“陷入自己的头脑”。一旦达到对创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的理解的临界质量，对他们来说，开始处理自己的情感至关重要。迟早，他们必须通过哀悼童年的损失来深化自己的工作。

Self-compassionate crying is an unparalleled tool for shrinking the obsessive perseverations of the critic, and for ameliorating the habit of compulsive rushing. As her recovery progresses, the flight type can acquire a “gearbox” that allows her to engage life at a variety of speeds, including neutral. Neutral is especially important for flight types to cultivate.

自我同情地哭泣是缩小批评者强迫性坚持的无比工具，也是改善强迫性匆忙习惯的方法。随着她的恢复进展，飞行类型的人可以掌握一个“变速箱”，让她能够以各种速度参与生活，包括空挡。对于飞行类型的人来说，空挡尤其重要培养。

If you are a flight type, there are a plethora of self-help books, CD’s and classes that can help you learn to relax and decrease the habit of habitual doing. This is so essential because you can get so lost in busyness, that you have difficulty seeing the forest from the trees. This makes you prone to prioritizing the wrong tasks and getting lost in inessential activities. When I am triggered, I often feel pulled to busy myself with the simplest and easiest tasks, sometimes losing sight of my key responsibilities.

如果你是逃避型人格，有很多自助书籍、CD 和课程可以帮助你学会放松，减少习惯性做事的习惯。这非常重要，因为你会陷入忙碌中，以至于难以看清事物的本质。这会让你倾向于优先处理错误的任务，陷入无关紧要的活动。当我被触发时，我常常感到被拉去忙于最简单、最容易的任务，有时甚至失去了我的主要责任。

In flashback, flight types can deteriorate into _chicken-with-its-head-cut-off_ mode, as fear and anxiety propel them into scattered activity. Spinning their wheels, they can rush about aimlessly, as if motion itself is the only thing important.

在回忆中，逃避型人格可能会陷入一种“头断鸡飞”的状态，因为恐惧和焦虑推动他们进入分散的活动。他们原地打转，可能会盲目地四处奔波，仿佛运动本身就是唯一重要的事情。

At such times the flight type can rescue himself from panicky flight by inverting an old cliché into: “Don’t just do something, stand there.” And, by stand there I mean stop and take some time to become centered - and to re-prioritize. To accomplish this I recommend three minute, mini-chair meditations. If you are a flight type, you can enhance your recovery greatly by giving yourself a [[null|]]few of these each day. You can start a chair meditation by closing your eyes. Gently ask your body to relax. Feel each of your major muscle groups and softly encourage them to relax. Breathe deeply and slowly.

在这样的时刻，飞行型的人可以通过将一个老套话颠倒过来来拯救自己从恐慌的飞行中：不要只是做点什么，站在那里。”通过“站在那里”，我的意思是停下来，花点时间让自己集中精力——并重新确定优先顺序。为了实现这一点，我建议进行三分钟的迷你椅子上冥想。如果你是飞行型的人，通过每天给自己一些这样的冥想，你可以大大增强你的恢复力。你可以通过闭上眼睛开始椅子上冥想。轻轻地让你的身体放松。感受你身体上的每一个主要肌肉群，并温柔地鼓励它们放松。深呼吸，慢慢呼吸。

When you have relaxed your muscles and deepened and slowed your breathing, ask yourself: “What is my most important priority right now? What is the most beneficial thing I can do next?”

当你放松了肌肉，深呼吸并放慢呼吸节奏后，问问自己：“我现在最重要的优先事项是什么？我接下来能做的最有益的事情是什么？”

As you get more proficient at this and can manage sitting for a longer time, try the question: “What hurt am I running from right now? Can I open my heart to the idea and image of soothing myself in my pain?”

随着你在这方面的技能越来越熟练，能够坐得更久，尝试这个问题：“我现在在逃避什么痛苦？我能对我自己在这痛苦中寻求安慰的想法和形象敞开心扉吗？”

Finally, there are numerous flight types who exhibit symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as Cyclothymia, a minor bipolar disorder. This issue is addressed at length in [[12. The Map_ Managing the Abandonment Depression|chapter 12]].

最后，有众多飞行类型表现出可能被误诊为环性心境障碍的病症，这是一种轻微的双相情感障碍。这个问题在第 12 章中进行了详细阐述。
