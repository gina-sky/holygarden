**Recovering From A Polarized Freeze Response  
  
从两极化的冻结反应中恢复**

Recovery for freeze types involves three key challenges.  
  
恢复冻结类型涉及三个关键挑战。

First, their positive relational experiences are few if any. They are therefore extremely reluctant to enter into the type of intimate relationship that can be transformative. They are even less likely to seek the aid of therapy. Moreover, those who manage to overcome this reluctance often spook easily and quickly terminate.  
  
首先，他们的积极人际关系经历很少，几乎没有。因此，他们非常不愿意进入那种可能具有变革性的亲密关系。他们寻求治疗帮助的可能性更小。此外，那些设法克服这种犹豫的人往往容易感到惊吓，并且很快就会终止。

Second, freeze types have two commonalities with fight types. They are less motivated to try to understand the effects [[null|]]of their childhood traumatization. Many are unaware that they have a troublesome inner critic or that they are in emotional pain. Furthermore, they tend to project the perfectionistic demands of the critic onto others rather than onto themselves. This survival mechanism helped them as children to use the imperfections of others as justification for isolation. In the past, isolation was smart, safety-seeking behavior.  
  
其次，冻结类型与战斗类型有两个共同点。他们不太愿意尝试理解自己童年创伤的影响。许多人没有意识到自己有一个麻烦的内心批评家，或者他们正在经历情感痛苦。此外，他们倾向于将批评家的完美主义要求投射到他人身上，而不是自己身上。这种生存机制在儿童时期帮助他们利用他人的不完美作为孤立的理由。在过去，孤立是一种明智的寻求安全的行为。

Third, even more than workaholic flight types, freeze types are in denial about the life narrowing consequences of their singular adaptation. Some freeze types that I have worked with seem to have significant periods of contentment with their isolation. I think they may be able to self-medicate by releasing the internal opioids that the animal brain is programmed to release when danger is so great that death seems imminent.  
  
第三，甚至比工作狂型飞行者更甚，冻结型的人对自己的单一适应方式所带来的生活狭窄后果持否认态度。我接触过的一些冻结型人似乎对自己的孤立状态感到相当满足。我认为他们可能通过释放动物大脑在危险极大、死亡似乎即将到来时程序化释放的内啡肽来自我治疗。

Internal opioid release is more accessible to freeze types because the freeze response has its own continuum that culminates with the collapse response. _The collapse response_ is an extreme abandonment of consciousness. It appears to be an out-of-body experience that is the ultimate dissociation. It can sometimes be seen in prey animals that are about to be killed. I have seen nature films of small animals in the jaws of a predator that show it letting go so thoroughly that its death appears to be painless.  
  
内啡肽的释放对冻结型人来说更容易获得，因为冻结反应有其自己的连续体，最终以崩溃反应结束。崩溃反应是对意识的极端放弃。它似乎是一种出体经验，是最终的解离。有时可以在即将被杀的猎物动物中看到这种反应。我看过关于小动物被掠食者咬在嘴里的自然纪录片，它彻底放手，看起来似乎没有痛苦。

However, the opioid production that some freeze types have access to, only takes the survivor so far before its analgesic properties no longer function. Numbed out contentment then morphs into serious depression. This in turn can lead to addictive self-medicating with substances like alcohol, marijuana and narcotics. Alternatively, the freeze type can gravitate toward ever escalating regimens of anti-depressants and anxiolytics. I also suspect that some schizophrenics are extremely traumatized freeze types who dissociate so thoroughly that they cannot find their way back to reality.  
  
然而，某些冻结类型能够获得的阿片类药物只能让幸存者维持到其镇痛特性不再发挥作用。随后，麻木的满足感转变为严重的抑郁。这进而可能导致对酒精、大麻和麻醉品等物质的成瘾性自我治疗。或者，冻结类型可能会倾向于不断升级的抗抑郁药和抗焦虑药治疗方案。我还怀疑，一些精神分裂症患者是极度受创伤的冻结类型，他们完全脱离现实，无法找到回归现实的道路。

[[null|]]Several of my freeze type respondents highly recommend a self-help book by Suzette Boon, entitled _Coping with Trauma-related Dissociation._ This book is filled with very helpful work sheets that are powerful tools for recovering.  
  
我的几位冻结类型受访者强烈推荐苏珊·布恩所著的自助书籍《应对创伤相关解离》。这本书充满了非常有用的工作表，是恢复的有力工具。

More than any other type, the freeze type usually requires a therapeutic relationship, because their isolation prevents them from discovering relational healing through a friendship. That said, I know of some instances where good enough relational healing has come through pets and the safer distant type of human healing that can be found in books and online internet groups.  
  
与其他类型相比，冻结类型通常需要治疗关系，因为他们的孤立阻止了他们通过友谊发现关系上的治愈。话虽如此，我知道有些情况下，通过宠物和书籍以及在线互联网小组中可以找到的更安全、更遥远的人类治愈方式，已经实现了足够的关系治愈。

Phyllis, a self-proclaimed couch potato, began therapy with me with a great deal of ambivalence. Her third brand of anti-depressants no longer worked and her daily pot use was making her increasingly paranoid. Fantasies of dying were becoming more frequent and morbid. She told me: “I know therapy won’t help, but I’m afraid my husband is going to leave me. He says I’m starting to scare him.”  
  
菲利斯，自称是个沙发土豆，开始接受我的治疗时充满了矛盾。她的第三种抗抑郁药不再有效，而且她每天吸大麻的行为让她越来越偏执。关于死亡的幻想变得越来越频繁和恐怖。她告诉我：“我知道治疗不会有帮助，但我害怕我的丈夫会离开我。他说我开始让他感到害怕。”

Phyllis managed being married because her husband paid the bills and left her alone with her TV shows, science fiction books and online browsing. Additionally he was a workaholic, rarely around and gone in the computer when he was home.  
  
菲利斯之所以能维持婚姻，是因为她的丈夫支付账单，让她独自看电视剧、读科幻小说和上网。此外，他是个工作狂，很少在家，即使在家也是沉迷于电脑。

In our therapy, trust building was a long gradual back and forth process. This is not un common with many survivors, regardless of their 4F type.  
  
在我们的治疗中，建立信任是一个漫长而缓慢的来回过程。这对许多幸存者来说并不罕见，无论他们的 4F 类型如何。

Phyllis’s dark sense of humor was a saving grace, and helped her weather my psychoeducation. She frequently met my attempts to link her current suffering and her awful childhood with sarcastic rebuttal. Fortunately, growing up in New York gave me some resilience to sarcasm. I was willing to weather her sardonic sense of humor because there was no mean spiritedness in it.  
  
菲利斯阴暗的幽默感是一种救赎，帮助她度过了我的心理教育。她经常用讽刺的回应来反驳我试图将她目前的痛苦和糟糕的童年联系起来。幸运的是，在纽约长大让我对讽刺有一定的抵抗力。我愿意忍受她的讽刺幽默，因为其中没有恶意。

[[null|]]Eventually I was able to help her direct the angry part of her sarcasm at her bullying family. With that, my psychoeducation finally began to seep in with a ring of truth. She gradually began to angrily vent about her father’s sexual abuse, her mother’s silent collusion, and all of the family using her for target practice. This in time morphed into crying which rewarded her with her first ever experience of self-compassion.  
  
最终，我帮助她将讽刺中的愤怒部分指向了欺负她的家人。就这样，我的心理教育终于带着真实感渗透了进去。她开始逐渐愤怒地发泄关于她父亲的性虐待、她母亲的沉默共谋以及全家人将她当作靶子练习的事情。这最终演变成了哭泣，这让她第一次体验到了自我同情。

It was not until we reached this stage, some years into the therapy, that Phyllis got a glimpse of the vicious inner critic that persecuted her. Prior to this she rebuffed my “critic ravings” as absurd. When we progressed sufficiently with the inner critic, the same process occurred with my hypotheses that she had a great deal of underlying fear and anxiety that was keeping her housebound. She laughed with a great deal of ironic amusement: “Look at me, Pete! Nothing scares me. I am so relaxed that I can hardly hold my body up in this chair. Jeez! You know I’m always nodding out. My husband calls me ‘Mellow Yellow.’”\[Phyllis is blonde\].  
  
在我们进行到这个阶段，也就是治疗几年后，菲利斯才看到了那个折磨她的恶毒内心批评者。在此之前，她认为我的“批评狂言”是荒谬的。当我们足够深入地处理内心批评者时，同样的过程也发生在我关于她有大量潜在恐惧和焦虑，这让她无法出门的假设上。她带着许多讽刺的幽默大笑：“看看我，皮特！没有什么能吓到我。我太放松了，几乎无法在这个椅子上支撑起我的身体。天哪！你知道我总是要打瞌睡。我丈夫叫我‘淡黄’。” \[菲利斯是金发\]。

A breakthrough eventually happened here when she passed a man on the sidewalk outside my office that was a doppelganger for her father. She came into the session on the verge of hyperventilating. As I helped her slow and deepen her breathing, she had a therapeutic flashback in the office. She had a horrifying memory of her father sneaking into her bedroom at night. Much grieving then resolved this particular flashback to her sexual abuse.  
  
一次突破终于在这里发生了，当她在我办公室外的街道上遇到一个和她父亲长得一模一样的人时。她进入治疗时几乎要窒息。在我帮助她放慢并加深呼吸的过程中，她在办公室里经历了一次治疗性回忆。她回忆起父亲夜间偷偷进入她的卧室的可怕记忆。这次回忆解决了她性侵犯的特定回忆所引起的悲伤。

Phyllis’s denial shrunk significantly in this session. She really “got” that social anxiety was imprisoning her on her couch. Deep level recovery work then ensued from this point in time, and culminated with Phyllis feeling emboldened enough to go back to school. She went on to become a medical assistant. This in turn opened the door to her finding a meaningful place in the outside world. A key part of the meaningfulness was the healthy friendship that she developed with a fellow worker who was also in recovery.  
  
在这场治疗中，菲利斯否认的程度显著减少。她真的“理解”了社交焦虑是如何将她囚禁在沙发上的。从那时起，她开始了深层次的治疗工作，最终她感到自己有足够的勇气重返学校。她成为了一名医疗助理。这反过来为她在外部世界找到一个有意义的位置打开了大门。其中关键的一部分是她与一位也在康复中的同事发展出的健康友谊。

[[null|]]The progression of recovery for a freeze type is often as follows. Gradual trust building allows the recoveree to open to psychoeducation about the role of dreadful parenting in his suffering. This then paves the way for the work of shrinking his critic, which in turn promotes the work of grieving the losses of childhood. The anger work of grieving is especially therapeutic for freeze types as is an aerobic exercise regime. Both help resuscitate the survivor’s dormant will and drive.  
  
冻类型恢复的进程通常如下。逐渐建立信任使恢复者愿意接受关于可怕父母在他痛苦中扮演角色的心理教育。这为缩小批评者的工作铺平了道路，进而促进了哀悼童年损失的工作。哀悼中的愤怒工作对冻类型特别有治疗作用，有氧运动计划也是如此。两者都有助于复苏幸存者的沉睡意志和动力。
