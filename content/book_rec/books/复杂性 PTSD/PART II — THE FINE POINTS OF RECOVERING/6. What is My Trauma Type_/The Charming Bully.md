\*\*The Charming Bully

迷人的恶霸\*\*

Especially devolved fight types can become sociopathic. Sociopathy can range along a continuum that stretches from corrupt politician to vicious criminal. A particularly nasty sociopath, who I call the charming bully, probably falls somewhere around the middle of this continuum. The charming bully behaves in a friendly manner some of the time. He can even occasionally listen and be helpful in small amounts, but he still uses his contempt to overpower and control others.

特别是退化严重的战斗类型可能会变得有社会病态。社会病态可以从腐败的政客到凶恶的罪犯，沿着一条连续体变化。一个特别恶劣的社会病态者，我称他为迷人的恶霸，可能在这个连续体的中间位置。迷人的恶霸有时会表现得友好。他甚至偶尔会倾听并给予一些帮助，但他仍然使用轻蔑来压倒和控制他人。

This type typically relies on scapegoats for the dumping of his vitriol. These unfortunate scapegoats are typically weaker than him. They may be members of a disenfranchised group: the “ethnic” employees, the gays, women, his “problem” child or wife, etc. He generally spares his favorites from this behavior, unless they get out of line.

这种类型的人通常依赖替罪羊来发泄他的恶意。这些不幸的替罪羊通常比他弱。他们可能是被剥夺权利的群体成员：比如“少数民族”员工、同性恋者、女性、他的“问题”孩子或妻子等。他通常不会让他的宠儿受到这种行为的影响，除非他们越界。

If the charming bully is charismatic enough, those close to him will often fail to register the unconscionable meanness of his scapegoating. The bully’s favorites often slip into denial, relieved that they are not the target. Especially charismatic bullies may even be admired and seen as great. Being the scapegoated child or spouse [[null|]]of such a bully is especially problematic because it is so difficult to get anyone to validate that you were or are being abused by them.

如果迷人的恶霸足够有魅力，那些接近他的人往往会忽视他替罪羊行为的不可容忍的刻薄。恶霸的宠儿常常陷入否认，庆幸自己不是目标。特别是魅力十足的恶霸甚至可能受到钦佩，被视为伟大。成为这样恶霸的替罪羊或配偶尤其有问题，因为很难让任何人证实你被他们虐待。

I remember how perplexed I used to be at photos of Hitler ostensibly acting kindly to his children. And I think as I write this of how many billionaires are venerated, and how most of them stand up very poorly to closer scrutiny. So many billionaires use sociopathic tactics to accrue their fortunes. Examples of this are hostile takeovers, exploitive labor policies, health destroying work conditions, devastating environmental practices and various other forms of cheating, lying and back-stabbing.

我记得我过去看到希特勒表面上对孩子们表现出慈爱时的困惑。而且，当我写这段话时，我想到了有多少亿万富翁被崇拜，以及他们中的大多数在更深入的审视下表现得非常糟糕。这么多亿万富翁使用精神病患者般的策略来积累他们的财富。这种策略的例子包括敌意接管、剥削性的劳动政策、破坏健康的劳动条件、破坏环境的做法以及各种其他形式的欺骗、谎言和背后捅刀子。

The “great” icon, Henry Ford, would regularly place new young workers at the front of his “innovative” assembly lines. The tired, used-up workers further down the line who could not then keep up were unceremoniously ushered out the back door. Labor unions eventually curtailed that practice in this country, but many jobs have since been exported to unregulated third world countries where workers labor in the same atrocious soul- and body-destroying conditions.

“伟大”的亨利·福特会定期将新来的年轻工人安排在他的“创新”生产线的前端。而那些在生产线下游疲惫不堪、无法跟上节奏的工人则被无礼地赶出了后门。工会最终在这个国家限制了这种做法，但许多工作随后被出口到不受监管的第三世界国家，那里的工人在同样恶劣的身心摧毁性条件下劳作。

And then, on a much less grand level, I remember a best friend I had in my twenties. I thought he was a great guy for almost two years until one day, shopping in the supermarket with him, I witnessed his demeaning lambasting of an innocent checker just out of sheer spite.

然后，在更小的层面上，我记得我二十多岁时有一个最好的朋友。我差不多有两年的时间认为他是个很棒的人，直到有一天，我和他在超市购物时，我目睹了他因为纯粹的无理取闹而贬低和责骂一个无辜的收银员。
