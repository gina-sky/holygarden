**Other Types Of Narcissists  
  
其他类型的自恋者**

_Rageaholic narcissists_ are infamous for using other people as dumping grounds for their anger. They are addicted to the emotional release of catharting in this way. The relief often does not last long before they are looking for another fix of venting their spleen.  
  
愤怒成瘾的自恋者以将他人作为他们愤怒的倾倒地而臭名昭著。他们沉迷于以这种方式宣泄情绪的释放。这种缓解通常不会持续太久，他们就会寻找另一种发泄怒气的途径。

[[null|]]This type of narcissism is pure bullying, and bullying alone can cause ptsd. If it goes on long enough as it does with bullying parents in a dysfunctional family, it can cause Cptsd. If this rings a bell with you, please check out [www.nobully.com](http://www.nobully.com) .  
  
这种类型自恋纯粹是欺凌，而欺凌本身可以导致创伤后应激障碍。如果持续时间足够长，就像在功能失调的家庭中与欺凌的父母一样，它可能导致复杂性创伤后应激障碍。如果您对此有所共鸣，请访问 www.nobully.com。

Furthermore, and closer to a key theme of this book, I report the evidence of more than a few clients who were horribly abused by their pillar-of-the-community, narcissistic parents. Among them is my suave silent-type father, who regularly raged at and backhanded me and my sisters. He was much admired in our neighborhood.  
  
此外，更接近本书的关键主题，我报道了多位客户被他们的社区支柱、自恋的父母可怕地虐待的证据。其中就有我那位优雅的沉默型父亲，他经常对我们姐妹俩大发雷霆，动手打我们。他在我们小区很受尊敬。

A final example of narcissism is the charming narcissist who is not necessarily a bully. I call this type _the narcissist in codependent clothing._ My friend’s father is this type of charming narcissist. When you meet him, he lures you in with questions and elicitation that make you feel like he is interested in you. But, within a few minutes \[once you have taken the bait\], he suddenly shifts into monologing like a filibusterer. This particular type often masters the run-on sentence and there is nary a pause to interject or even offer an excuse for escaping. You have become a captive audience and your release will not be procured easily.  
  
自恋的另一个例子是迷人的自恋者，他们不一定是个霸凌者。我把这种类型称为“共生型自恋者”。我朋友的父亲就是这种迷人的自恋者。当你见到他时，他会用问题和引诱让你觉得他对你的兴趣很大。但是，一旦你上了钩\[一旦你被吸引\]，他突然就会像辩论家一样开始独白。这种类型的人通常擅长长句，几乎没有停顿让你插话，甚至为你逃跑找借口。你变成了一个被俘的听众，你的释放不会轻易到来。
