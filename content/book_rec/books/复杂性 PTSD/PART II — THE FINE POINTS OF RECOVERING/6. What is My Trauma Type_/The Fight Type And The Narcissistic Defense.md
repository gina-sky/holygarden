\*\*THE FIGHT TYPE AND THE NARCISSISTIC DEFENSE

战斗型人格和自恋防御\*\*

Fight types are unconsciously driven by the belief that power and control can create safety, assuage abandonment and secure love. Children who are spoiled and given insufficient limits \[a uniquely painful type of abandonment\] can become fight types. Children who are allowed to imitate the bullying of a narcissistic parent may also develop a habitual fight response. Numerous fight types start out as older siblings who over-power their younger siblings just as their parent over-powers them.

战斗型人格是无意识地受到这样的信念驱动的：力量和控制可以创造安全感，减轻被遗弃的感觉，并确保爱情。被宠坏且缺乏适当限制的孩子\[一种独特的痛苦类型的遗弃\]可能会成为战斗型人格。允许孩子模仿自恋型父母的欺凌行为的孩子也可能发展出习惯性的战斗反应。许多战斗型人格最初是作为年长的兄弟姐妹，他们像父母一样压倒年幼的兄弟姐妹。

战斗类型学会用愤怒来回应被遗弃的感觉。许多人使用轻蔑，一种自恋愤怒和厌恶的毒液混合物，来恐吓和羞辱他人，使他们模仿自己。自恋者将他人视为自己的一部分。

The entitled fight type commonly uses others as an audience for his incessant monologing. He may treat a “captured” freeze or fawn type as a slave in a dominance-submission relationship. The price of admission to a relationship with an extreme narcissist is self-annihilation. One of my clients quipped: “Narcissists don’t have relationships; they take prisoners.”

有特权的战斗类型通常将他人视为自己无休止独白的观众。他可能会将“被捕获”的冻结或奉承类型视为支配-服从关系中的奴隶。与极端自恋者建立关系的代价是自我毁灭。我的一个客户打趣说：“自恋者没有关系，他们只是抓了俘虏。”
