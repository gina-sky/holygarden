\*\*SELF-ASSESSMENT

自我评估\*\*

I recommend that you self-assess your own hierarchical use of the 4F responses. Try to determine your dominant type and hybrid, and think about what percentage of your time is spent in each of the 4F responses.

我建议您自我评估自己对 4F 反应的层级使用。尝试确定您的优势类型和混合类型，并思考您在每种 4F 反应上花费的时间百分比。

You can also assess where you lie on the relevant continuums that stretch between the two extremes in each line of the chart below.

您还可以评估自己在下图中每行两个极端之间的相关连续体上的位置。
