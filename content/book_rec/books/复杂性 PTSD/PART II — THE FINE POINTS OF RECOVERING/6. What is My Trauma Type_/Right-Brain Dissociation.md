\*\*Right-Brain Dissociation

右脑解离\*\*

It is often the scapegoat or the most profoundly abandoned child, “the lost child”, who is forced to habituate to the freeze response. Not allowed to successfully employ fight, flight or fawn responses, the freeze type’s defenses develop around classical or right-brain dissociation. Dissociation allows the freeze type to disconnect from experiencing his abandonment pain, and protects him from risky social interactions - any of which might trigger feelings of being retraumatized.

它通常是替罪羊或最被彻底遗弃的孩子，“那个失落的孩子”，被迫习惯于冻结反应。不允许成功运用战斗、逃跑或讨好反应，冻结类型的防御机制围绕着古典或右脑解离发展。解离使冻结类型能够从体验被遗弃的痛苦中抽离出来，并保护他免受风险性社交互动——任何可能引发被再次创伤感的互动。

If you are a freeze type, you may seek refuge and comfort by dissociating in prolonged bouts of sleep, daydreaming, wishing and right-brain-dominant activities like TV, online browsing and video games.

如果你是冻结类型，你可能会通过长时间的睡眠、白日梦、愿望以及以右脑为主导的活动（如看电视、在线浏览和玩电子游戏）来寻求庇护和安慰。

Freeze types sometimes have or appear to have Attention Deficit Disorder \[ADD\]. They often master the art of changing the internal channel whenever inner experience becomes uncomfortable. When they are especially traumatized or triggered, they may exhibit a schizoid-like detachment from ordinary reality. And in worst case scenarios, they can decompensate into a schizophrenic experience like the main character in the book, _I Never Promised You a Rose Garden_.

冻结类型有时会有或看起来有注意力缺陷障碍\[ADD\]。他们通常擅长在内在体验变得不舒服时改变内心的频道。当他们特别受到创伤或触发时，他们可能会表现出类似精神分裂症的症状，与现实生活脱节。在最糟糕的情况下，他们可能会出现类似书中主角的经历，就像《我从未承诺给你一个玫瑰花园》中的主角一样。
