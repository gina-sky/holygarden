\*\*Recovering From A Polarized Fawn Response

从极化的小鹿反应中恢复\*\*

Fawn types typically respond to psychoeducation about the 4F’s with great relief. This eventually helps them to recognize the repetition compulsion that draws them to narcissistic types who exploit them.

小鹿类型的人通常对关于 4F 的心理教育感到极大的解脱。这最终帮助他们认识到重复的冲动，这种冲动使他们被那些剥削他们的自恋型人格所吸引。

The codependent needs to understand how she gives herself away by over-listening to others. Recovery involves shrinking her characteristic listening defense, as well as practicing and broadening her verbal and emotional self-expression.

依赖型的人需要理解她是如何通过过度倾听他人而放弃自己的。恢复过程包括缩小她特有的倾听防御机制，以及练习和拓宽她的言语和情感自我表达。

I have seen numerous inveterate codependents become motivated to work on their assertiveness when they realize that even the thought of saying “no” triggers them into an emotional flashback. After a great deal of work, one client was shocked by how intensely he dissociated when he contemplated confronting his boss’s awful behavior. This shock then morphed into an epiphany of outrage about how dangerous it had been to protest anything in his family. This in turn aided him greatly in overcoming his resistance to role-playing assertiveness in our future work together.

我看到许多根深蒂固的依赖型人意识到，当他们意识到仅仅想到说“不”就会触发他们的情感闪回时，他们会开始努力提高自己的自信。经过大量的工作，一位客户对他的老板的糟糕行为进行对抗时，他惊讶地发现自己如何强烈地解离。这种震惊随后转变为对他在家庭中抗议任何事情的危险的愤怒启示。这反过来又极大地帮助他在我们未来合作中克服对角色扮演自信的抵抗。

With considerable practice, this client learned to overcome the critic voices that immediately short-circuited him from ever asserting himself. In the process, he remembered how he was repeatedly forced to stifle his individuality in childhood. Grieving these losses then helped him to work at reclaiming his developmentally arrested self-expression. Recovering from the fawn position will be explored more extensively in the [[7. Recovering From Trauma-Based Codependency|next chapter]].

经过大量练习，这位客户学会了克服那些立即让他无法自信表达的批评声音。在这个过程中，他想起了自己在童年时期反复被迫压抑个性的经历。对这些损失的哀悼帮助他努力恢复被发展停滞的自我表达。在下一章中，我们将更深入地探讨从“谄媚”位置恢复的过程。
