\*\*Healthy Employment Of The 4 F’s

4F 的健康运用\*\*

People who experience “good enough parenting” in childhood arrive in adulthood with a healthy and flexible response repertoire to danger. In the face of real danger, they have appropriate access to all of their 4F choices.

童年经历过“足够好”的养育方式的人，成年后拥有健康灵活的危险应对策略。面对真实危险时，他们能够适当地运用所有 4F 选择。

Easy access to the _fight_ response insures good boundaries, healthy assertiveness and aggressive self-protectiveness if necessary.

轻松访问战斗反应确保了良好的界限、健康的自信和必要时具有侵略性的自我保护。

Untraumatized people also easily and appropriately access their _flight_ instinct and disengage and retreat when confrontation would exacerbate their danger.

未受创伤的人也能轻松适当地运用他们的逃跑本能，在对抗会加剧危险时撤退和脱离。

Untraumatized people also _freeze_ appropriately and give up and quit struggling when further activity or resistance is futile or counterproductive. Additionally, the freeze response is sometimes our first response to danger, as when we become still, quiet and camouflaged to buy time, to assess the danger and decide whether fight, flight, continued freeze or fawn is our best option.

未受创伤的人也能适当地冻结，放弃并停止挣扎，当进一步的活动或抵抗是徒劳或反效果时。此外，冻结反应有时是我们对危险的最初反应，比如当我们静止、安静并伪装起来以争取时间，评估危险并决定战斗、逃跑、继续冻结或讨好是我们的最佳选择。

And finally, untraumatized people also _fawn_ in a non-groveling manner and are able to listen, help, and compromise as readily as they assert and express themselves and their needs, rights and points of view. A deeper elaboration of the origins of these four defenses is found below and in the [[7. Recovering From Trauma-Based Codependency|next chapter]].

最后，未受创伤的人也会以非卑躬屈膝的方式讨好，并且能够像他们主张和表达自己及其需求和观点一样，轻松地倾听、帮助和妥协。这四种防御机制的起源的更深入阐述可以在下面和下一章中找到。

[[null|]]Those who are repetitively traumatized in childhood often learn to survive by over-using one or two of the 4F Reponses. Fixation in any one 4F response not only limits our ability to access all the others, but also severely impairs our ability to relax into an undefended state. Additionally, it strands us in a narrow, impoverished experience of life.

在童年时期反复遭受创伤的人常常学会通过过度使用四种 F 反应中的其中一种或两种来生存。固定在任何一种 4F 反应中不仅限制了我们访问其他所有反应的能力，而且严重损害了我们放松到无防御状态的能力。此外，它使我们陷入一种狭窄、贫瘠的生活体验。

Over time a habitual 4F defense also “serves” to distract us from the nagging voice of the critic and the painful feelings that underlie it. Preoccupation with 4F behaviors dulls our awareness of our unresolved past trauma and the pain of our current alienation.

随着时间的推移，习惯性的 4F 防御机制也“服务于”分散我们对批评者那令人烦恼的声音及其背后的痛苦感受的注意力。对 4F 行为的专注使我们对未解决的过去创伤和当前疏离的痛苦变得麻木。

This chart compares the harmful behaviors of each defensive structure. Real or imagined danger typically triggers us into these roles and behaviors when we are in an emotional flashback.

此图表比较了每种防御结构的危害行为。真实或想象中的危险通常在我们处于情绪闪回时触发我们进入这些角色和行为。
