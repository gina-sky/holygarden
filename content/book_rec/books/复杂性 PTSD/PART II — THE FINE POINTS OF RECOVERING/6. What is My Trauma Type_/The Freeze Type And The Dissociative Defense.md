\*\*THE FREEZE TYPE AND THE DISSOCIATIVE DEFENSE

冻结类型与解离性防御\*\*

The freeze response, also known as the camouflage response, often triggers a survivor into hiding, isolating and avoiding human contact. The freeze type can be so frozen in the retreat mode that it seems as if their starter button is stuck in the “off” position.

冻结反应，也称为伪装反应，常常使幸存者躲藏、孤立并避免与人接触。冻结类型可能会在撤退模式中变得如此僵化，以至于他们的启动按钮似乎卡在了“关闭”位置。

Of all the 4F’s, freeze types seem to have the deepest unconscious belief that people and danger are synonymous. While all 4F types commonly suffer from social anxiety as well, freeze types typically take a great deal more refuge in solitude. Some freeze types completely give up on relating to others and become extremely isolated. Outside of fantasy, many also give up entirely on the possibility of love.

在所有 4F 类型中，冻结类型似乎对人们和危险是同义的这一信念有着最深的无意识信念。虽然所有 4F 类型都普遍患有社交焦虑，但冻结类型通常在孤独中寻求更多的庇护。一些冻结类型完全放弃与他人建立联系，变得极其孤立。在幻想之外，许多人也完全放弃了爱的可能性。
