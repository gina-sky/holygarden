\*\*THE FAWN TYPE AND THE CODEPENDENT DEFENSE

鹿类型和共依存防御\*\*

Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs and demands of others. They act as if they believe that the price of admission to any relationship is the forfeiture of all their needs, rights, preferences and boundaries.

鹿类型通过与他人愿望、需求和要求的融合来寻求安全。他们表现得好像相信，进入任何关系的代价是放弃他们所有的需求、权利、偏好和界限。

The disenfranchisement of the fawn type begins in childhood. She learns early that a modicum of safety and attachment can be gained by becoming the helpful and compliant servant of her exploitive parents.

鹿类型的剥夺开始于童年。她很早就学会了，通过成为剥削性父母的顺从和有用的仆人，可以获得一定程度的保护和依恋。

A fawn type/codependent is usually the child of at least one narcissistic parent. The narcissist reverses the parent-child relationship. The child is _parentified_ and takes care of the needs of the parent, who acts like a needy and sometimes tantruming child.

一种鹿型/依赖型的人通常是至少有一个自恋型父母的子女。自恋者颠倒了亲子关系。孩子被父母化，照顾父母的需求，而父母表现得像一个需要照顾有时还会闹脾气的孩子。

When this occurs, the child may be turned into the parent’s confidant, substitute spouse, coach, or housekeeper. Or, she may be pressed into service to mother the younger siblings. In worst case scenarios, she may be exploited sexually.

当这种情况发生时，孩子可能会成为父母的密友、替代配偶、教练或管家。或者，她可能被迫照顾年幼的兄弟姐妹。在最糟糕的情况下，她可能会遭受性剥削。

Some codependent children adapt by becoming entertaining. Accordingly, the child learns to be the court jester and is unofficially put in charge of keeping his parent happy.

一些共依性儿童通过成为娱乐者来适应。因此，孩子学会了成为小丑，并非正式地负责让父母开心。

Pressing a child into codependent service usually involves scaring and shaming him out of developing a sense of self. Of all the 4F types, fawn types are the most developmentally arrested in their healthy sense of self.

将孩子逼入相互依赖的服务通常涉及恐吓和羞辱，使他无法形成自我意识。在所有 4F 类型中，鹿型在健康自我意识方面发展停滞最为严重。
