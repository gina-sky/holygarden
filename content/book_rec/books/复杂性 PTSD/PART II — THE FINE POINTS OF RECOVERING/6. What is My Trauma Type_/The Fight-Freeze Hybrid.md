**The Fight-Freeze Hybrid  
  
战斗-冻结混合体**

These types rarely seek recovery on their own initiative. A colleague of mine told me about a fight-freeze type who was dragged into therapy by his wife. She complained that she was lucky to get ten words out of him in a week. She was at the end of her rope and if therapy did not fix him, she was filing for divorce.  
  
这些类型很少会主动寻求恢复。我的一个同事告诉我，有一个避免冲突的类型是被他的妻子拖去治疗的。她抱怨自己一周只能从他那里得到十个字。她已经筋疲力尽，如果治疗不能让他改变，她就要提出离婚。

The husband was a computer engineer who telecommuted and only left his home office for bathroom breaks and meals which were eaten separately from his wife. He bullied his wife into providing these meals according to a written schedule that he e-mailed to her.  
  
这位丈夫是一名远程工作的计算机工程师，他只在家办公，只有在上厕所和吃饭时才会离开办公室，而吃饭时他和妻子是分开的。他强迫妻子按照他通过电子邮件发给她的一份书面日程安排提供这些饭菜。

My colleague’s initial “Hello” to the husband was met with a scowl and a grunt. Intuitively, she kept the focus off him as much as possible, but each delicate attempt to make connection with him was rebuffed with sarcastic scorn. “You expect me to fall for that phony smile?”; “You’re not gonna shrink me with your psychobabble!”  
  
我的同事最初对这位丈夫说的“你好”遭到了一个怒容和一声咕哝。出于直觉，她尽可能地不把焦点放在他身上，但每次试图与他建立联系的微妙尝试都遭到了讽刺的嘲笑。“你指望我会被那个假笑骗到？”；“你不会用你的心理术语来缩小我吧！”

My colleague, who is the most compassionate, non-intrusive person I know, was not able to crack the prickly fight shell that guarded this poor man’s extreme social withdrawal. No miracle was performed, and my colleague said she was amazed in retrospect that he even lasted twenty minutes before he left in a wake of hostility and resentment.  
  
我的同事，是我所认识的最有同情心、最不侵扰的人，却无法破解保护这位极度社交退缩的可怜人的刺猬式战斗外壳。没有奇迹发生，我的同事事后惊讶地说，他甚至坚持了二十分钟才带着敌意和怨恨离开。

[[null|]]I have met with fight-freeze types a few times in similar circumstances, i.e., they were dragged into therapy under the threat of divorce. Each was like the character in the famous poem: “The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table.”  
  
我在类似情况下遇到过几次战斗-冻结型的人，即他们是在面临离婚威胁的情况下被拖进治疗的。每个人都像著名诗歌中的角色：“早餐桌上的独裁者”。

The fight-freeze is a yin or passive narcissist. He demands that things go his way, but he is not much interested in having any human interaction. No one gets to talk at the table, not even him – unless of course someone needs to be put in their place.  
  
战斗-冻结型的人是阴性的或被动的自恋者。他要求事情按照他的方式发展，但他对与人互动并不感兴趣。没有人能在桌上说话，甚至他也不例外——除非当然有人需要被置于他的位置。

The fight-freeze type is a John Wayne couch potato, dominating family life with foul moods and monosyllabic grunts and curses. He is typically as untreatable as the extreme fight types mentioned earlier.  
  
战斗-冻结型的人就像一个约翰·韦恩式的沙发土豆，用恶劣的情绪和单音节的咕哝和诅咒来主宰家庭生活。他通常和前面提到的极端战斗型一样难以治疗。
