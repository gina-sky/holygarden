\*\*CPTSD AS AN ATTACHMENT DISORDER

创伤后应激障碍作为一种依恋障碍\*\*

Excessive reliance on a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response is the traumatized child’s unconscious attempt to cope with constant danger. It is also a strategy to strengthen the illusion that her parents really care about her.

过度依赖战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好反应是受创伤的儿童无意识地应对持续危险的一种尝试。这同样是一种策略，用以加强她父母真正关心她的错觉。

In adult life, all 4F types are commonly ambivalent about real intimacy. This is because closeness often triggers us into painful emotional flashbacks. It reminds us of how we had to survive without comforting connection in childhood. Our 4F defenses therefore offer protection against further re-abandonment by precluding the type of vulnerable relating that leads to deeper bonding.

在成年生活中，所有 4F 类型的人通常对真正的亲密关系感到矛盾。这是因为亲近往往引发我们痛苦的回忆。它让我们想起我们如何在童年时期没有安慰性的联系中生存。因此，我们的 4F 防御机制提供保护，防止进一步的遗弃，通过排除导致更深层次联系的那种脆弱的关系。

A survivor also avoids vulnerable relating because his past makes him believe that he will be attacked or abandoned as he was in childhood. This is why showing vulnerability often triggers painful emotional flashbacks.

幸存者也避免脆弱的关系，因为他的过去让他相信他会被攻击或遗弃，就像他在童年时期所经历的那样。这就是为什么表现出脆弱往往引发痛苦的情感回忆。

Many _fight types_ avoid real intimacy by alienating others with their angry and controlling demands for unconditional love. This unrealistic demand to have their unmet childhood needs met destroys the possibility of intimacy. Moreover, some fight types delude themselves into believing that they are perfect. They see the other as the one who needs to be perfected. This defensive belief then _entitles_ them to totally blame their partners for relationship problems.

许多战斗类型的人通过愤怒和控制性的要求无条件的爱来与他人疏远，以避免真正的亲密关系。这种不切实际的要求满足他们未满足的童年需求，破坏了亲密关系的可能性。此外，一些战斗类型的人自欺欺人地认为自己完美无缺。他们认为对方是需要被完善的那个人。这种防御性信念使他们有权完全责怪伴侣关系中的问题。

Many _flight types_ stay perpetually busy and industrious to avoid being triggered by deeper relating. Others also work obsessively to perfect themselves hoping to someday become worthy enough of love. Such flight types have great difficulty showing anything but their perfect persona.

许多飞行类型始终忙碌而勤奋，以避免被更深层次的联系触发。其他人也沉迷于自我完善，希望有一天能配得上爱。这种飞行类型很难展现出除了他们完美形象之外的东西。

Many _freeze types_ hide away in their rooms and reveries fully convinced that the world of relating holds nothing for them. Freeze type who have not been totally turned off relationships by horrible childhood neglect or abuse, gravitate to online relationships. [[null|]]Online relating can be pursued safely at home with as little contact as desired.

许多冻结类型躲在自己的房间里，沉浸在自己的幻想中，深信联系的世界对他们来说毫无意义。那些没有被可怕的童年忽视或虐待完全关闭关系的冻结类型，会倾向于在线关系。在线联系可以在家中安全地进行，接触程度可以根据自己的意愿来调整。

Many _fawn types_ avoid emotional investment and potential disappointment by barely showing themselves. They hide behind their helpful personas and over-listen, over-elicit and/or overdo for the other. By over-focusing on their partners, they then do not have to risk real self-exposure and the possibility of deeper level rejection.

许多奉承类型通过几乎不展示自己来避免情感投入和潜在的失望。他们隐藏在乐于助人的面具背后，过度倾听，过度索取和/或过度为对方付出。通过过度关注他们的伴侣，他们就不必冒险进行真正的自我暴露和更深层次被拒绝的可能性。

Now let us examine each of the 4F defenses more closely with a view toward decreasing our overreliance on them.

现在，让我们更仔细地审视 4F 防御机制，目的是减少我们对它们的过度依赖。
