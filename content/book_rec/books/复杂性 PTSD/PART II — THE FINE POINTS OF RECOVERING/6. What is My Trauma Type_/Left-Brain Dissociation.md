\*\*Left-Brain Dissociation

左脑解离\*\*

When the obsessive/compulsive flight type is not doing, she is worrying and planning about doing. She becomes what John Bradshaw [[null|]]calls a Human Doing \[as opposed to a Human Being.\] Obsessiveness is left-brain dissociation, as opposed to the classic right-brain dissociation of the freeze type described below.

当强迫性/强迫性飞行类型不行动时，她就会担心和计划行动。她变成了约翰·布拉德肖所说的“人类行动者”（与“人类存在者”相对）。强迫性是左脑解离，与下面描述的冻结类型的经典右脑解离相反。

_Left-brain dissociation_ is using constant thinking to distract yourself from underlying abandonment pain. When thinking is worrying, it is as if underlying fear wafts up and taints the thinking process. Moreover, if compulsivity is hurrying to stay one step ahead of your repressed pain, obsessing is worrying to stay one level above underlying pain.

左脑解离是利用持续的思考来分散自己从潜在的被遗弃的痛苦。当思考变得担忧时，就像潜在的恐惧飘起并污染了思考过程。此外，如果强迫性是急于领先于你压抑的痛苦，那么强迫性就是担心保持在潜在痛苦之上。

As a flight type myself, I sometimes find myself obsessively worrying through my outline just before a lecture. I do it, in part, to stay buoyant above my performance anxiety \[a subset of my abandonment fear\]. In my early days of teaching I would also employ a compulsive defense and pace as I anxiously searched my brain for a missing word. Sometimes I would even scramble frantically through the dictionary or thesaurus to find it. Unconsciously it was like I was searching for a safe place beyond the gravity of my anxiety.

作为一个逃跑型的人，我有时发现自己会在讲座前通过大纲强迫性地担忧。我这样做，部分是为了保持我的表现焦虑之上\[我的被遗弃恐惧的一个子集\]。在我教书的早期，我也会在焦虑地搜索大脑寻找缺失的单词时使用强迫性的防御和步调。有时我甚至会疯狂地翻阅字典或同义词典来找到它。无意识地，这就像我正在寻找一个超越我焦虑重力的安全地方。

Flight types are also prone to becoming addicted to their own adrenalin. Some recklessly and regularly pursue risky and dangerous activities to jumpstart an adrenalin-high. Flight types are also susceptible to the process addictions of workaholism and busy-holism. To keep these processes humming, they can deteriorate into stimulating substance addictions.

飞行类型的人也容易沉迷于自己的肾上腺素。他们有些人会鲁莽且定期追求危险的活动，以激发肾上腺素的高潮。飞行类型的人也容易受到工作狂和忙碌狂的过程成瘾。为了保持这些过程的运转，他们可能会陷入刺激物质的成瘾。

Severely traumatized flight types may devolve into obsessive-compulsive disorder \[OCD\].

严重受创伤的飞行类型可能会发展成强迫症。
