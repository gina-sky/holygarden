**The Fight** ![](books/复杂性%20PTSD/images/00002.jpeg) **Fawn Continuum of Healthy Relating to Others**

0# Fawn 健康关系连续体

Healthy relating occurs when two people move easily and reciprocally between assertiveness and receptivity. Common and important examples of this are an easy back and forth \[1\] between talking and listening, \[2\] between helping and being helped, and \[3\] between leading and following.

当两个人在自信和接受之间轻松且相互地移动时，就会发生健康的关系。这种关系的常见和重要例子包括：\[1\] 谈话和倾听之间的轻松来回，\[2\] 帮助和被帮助之间的来回，以及\[3\] 领导和跟随之间的来回。

Normal healthy narcissism and codependence happen at the midpoint of the continuum. To the degree that I polarize to the narcissistic/fight end of the continuum, I monologue and dominate the conversation. To the degree that I polarize to the codependent/fawn end, I get stuck in a listening defense, hiding from the vulnerability of showing what I think and feel.

正常健康的自恋和相互依赖发生在连续体的中点。在连续体中，我偏向自恋/对抗的一端时，我会独白并主导对话。在偏向相互依赖/奉承的一端时，我会陷入倾听防御，躲避展示自己想法和感受的脆弱性。

Conversations, of course, will not always be exactly in the middle or it would be a Ping-Pong-like exchange of monosyllables. The real balance occurs more over time. For instance, in an hour’s conversation, we each generally talk about half the time.

当然，对话并不总是恰好位于中间，否则就会像乒乓球一样交换单音节词。真正的平衡更多是在时间上发生的。例如，在一个小时的对话中，我们每个人通常各说一半的时间。
