\*\*Recovery And Self-Assessment

恢复与自我评估\*\*

As stated earlier, a key goal of recovery is to have easy and appropriate access to all of the 4F’s. There are also two more continuums [[null|]]that can be used to assess this. The degree to which we are balanced along each of them reflects the degree of our healing.

如前所述，恢复的关键目标是有轻松且适当的途径获取所有 4F。此外，还有两个连续体可以用来评估这一点。我们在每个连续体上的平衡程度反映了我们的恢复程度。
