**The Flight-Freeze Hybrid  
  
飞行-冻结混合型**

The Flight-Freeze type is the least relational and most schizoid hybrid. He prefers the safety of do-it-yourself isolationism. Sometimes this type may also be misdiagnosed as Asperger’s Syndrome.  
  
飞行-冻结型是最不具关系性和最分裂的混合型。他更喜欢 DIY 隔离的安全感。有时这种类型也可能被误诊为阿斯伯格综合症。

The flight-freeze type avoids potential relationship-retraumati-zation with an obsessive-compulsive/dissociative “two-step.” Step one is working to complete exhaustion. Step two is collapsing into extreme “veging out”, and waiting until his energy reaccumulates enough to relaunch into step one. The price for this type of no-longer-necessary safety is a severely narrowed existence.  
  
飞行-冻结型通过一种强迫性/解离性的“两步走”来避免潜在的关系创伤。第一步是工作到精疲力尽。第二步是彻底崩溃，进入极端的“休息”状态，等待他的能量重新积累到足够再次启动第一步。这种不再必要的安全感的代价是存在范围的严重缩小。

The flight-freeze cul-de-sac is more common among men, especially those traumatized for being vulnerable in childhood. This then drives them to seek safety in isolation or “intimacy-lite” relationships.  
  
无飞行-冻结死胡同在男性中更为常见，尤其是那些因童年脆弱而受到创伤的人。这使他们寻求在孤立或“亲密度低”的关系中寻求安全。

Some non-alpha type male survivors combine their flight and freeze defenses to become stereotypical technology nerds. Telecommuting is, of course, their preferred mode. Flight-freeze [[null|]]types are the computer addicts who focus on work for long periods of time and then drift off dissociatively into computer games, substance abuse or sleep-bingeing.  
  
一些非 alpha 型男性幸存者将他们的飞行和冻结防御结合起来，成为典型的技术宅。远程办公当然是他们首选的模式。飞行-冻结类型的人是沉迷于电脑的瘾君子，他们长时间专注于工作，然后分心地沉迷于电脑游戏、物质滥用或睡眠狂热。

Flight-freeze types are prone to becoming porn addicts. When in flight mode, they obsessively surf the net for phantom partners and engage in compulsive masturbation. When in freeze mode, they drift off into a right-brain sexual fantasy world if pornography is unavailable. Moreover, if they are in intimacy-lite relationship, they typically engage more with their idealized fantasy partners than with their actual partner during real time sexual interactions.  
  
飞行-冻结类型的人容易成为色情瘾君子。在飞行模式下，他们会狂热地在网上寻找幽灵般的伴侣，并进行强迫性的自慰。在冻结模式下，如果找不到色情内容，他们会飘入右脑的性幻想世界。此外，如果他们处于亲密度低的关系中，他们在现实时间性互动中通常更多地与理想化的幻想伴侣互动，而不是与他们的实际伴侣。
