**The Fight-Fawn Hybrid  
  
战斗-谄媚混合体**

The Fight-Fawn type corresponds with the charming bully described earlier. This type combines two opposite polarities of relational style – narcissism and codependence. Narcissistic entitlement, however, is typically at the core of the fight-fawn type. This type, in the extreme, can also be Borderline Personality Disorder \[BPD\]. She can frequently and dramatically vacillate \[split\] between a fight and fawn defense. When a fight-fawn type is upset with someone, she can fluctuate over and over between attacking diatribes and fervent declarations of caring in a single interaction.  
  
战斗鹿类型与前面描述的迷人霸王相对应。这种类型结合了两种相反的关系风格极性——自恋和相互依赖。然而，自恋的特权通常是战斗鹿类型的核心。这种类型在极端情况下也可能是边缘型人格障碍\[BPD\]。她可以频繁且戏剧性地在战斗和讨好防御之间摇摆。当一个战斗鹿类型对某人生气时，她可以在一次互动中反复在攻击性的长篇大论和热烈的关心声明之间波动。

The fight-fawn is more deeply understood by contrasting him with the _fawn-fight_, described in the [[7. Recovering From Trauma-Based Codependency|next chapter]]. This fawn-fight type is also subject to vacillating during an emotional flashback, but typically does so with less vitriol and entitlement.  
  
通过将他与下一章中描述的鹿战斗类型进行对比，可以更深入地理解战斗鹿。这种鹿战斗类型在情绪闪回期间也会摇摆，但通常带有较少的恶意和特权。

The fight-fawn also differs from the fawn-fight in that his “care-taking” often feels coercive or manipulative. It is frequently aimed at achieving personal agendas which range from blatant to covert. Moreover, the fight-fawn rarely takes any real responsibility for contributing to an interpersonal problem. He typically ends up in the classic fight position of projecting imperfection onto the other. This essentially narcissistic type is also different than the fawn-fight in that entitlement is typically much more ascendant in the fight-fawn. His fawn behavior is typically devoid of real empathy or compassion.  
  
战斗小鹿与战斗-小鹿的不同之处在于，他的“照顾”往往感觉是强制性的或操纵性的。这通常是为了实现从明显到隐蔽的个人目标。此外，战斗小鹿很少真正承担起对人际问题做出贡献的责任。他通常最终会陷入经典的对立位置，将不完美投射到他人身上。这种本质上自恋的类型与战斗-小鹿的不同之处在于，在战斗小鹿身上，特权感通常更为强烈。他的小鹿行为通常缺乏真正的同理心或同情心。 我曾与几位客户合作过，他们被自己或他人不公平地贴上了边缘型的标签。然而，我可以根据他们内心的品质来判断，他们并非如此。这可以从他们对他人的基本善良和善意中得到证明，当闪回解决时，他们总是回到这一点。他们还在伤害他人时表现出真正的悔恨和愧疚，这是我们有时注定会做的事情。与具有自恋核心的真正边缘型不同，当适当的时候，他们可以真诚地道歉并做出补偿。

I have worked with several clients who were unfairly labeled borderline by themselves or others. I could however tell by the quality [[null|]]of their hearts, that they were not. This was evidenced by their essential kindness and goodwill to others, which they always return to when the flashback resolves. They also exhibit this in their ability to feel and show true remorse when they hurt another, as we are all destined to do from time to time. Unlike the true borderline who has a narcissistic core, they can sincerely apologize and make amends when appropriate.

Another variant of the fight/fawn is seen in the person who acts like a fight type in one relationship while fawning in another. An example of this is the archetypal henpecked husband who is a tyrant at work, and who also stays at work to all hours because he so prefers the fight stance. This type also occurs in reverse: monster at home and lovely lady at the office.  
  
另一种战斗/顺从的变体是那种在一种关系中表现得像战斗型，而在另一种关系中却顺从的人。一个例子是典型的受妻子管教的丈夫，他在工作中是个暴君，而且因为更喜欢战斗姿态，所以总是加班。这种类型也可以反过来：在家是怪物，在办公室是可爱的女士。
