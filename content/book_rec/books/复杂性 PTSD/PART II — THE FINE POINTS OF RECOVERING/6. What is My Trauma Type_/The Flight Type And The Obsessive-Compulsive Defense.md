\*\*THE FLIGHT TYPE AND THE OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DEFENSE

逃逸型与强迫性-强迫性防御\*\*

Extreme flight types are like machines with the switch stuck in the “on” position. They are obsessively and compulsively driven by the unconscious belief that perfection will make them safe and love-able. They rush to achieve. They rush as much in thought \[obsession\] as they do in action \[compulsion\].

极端飞行类型就像开关一直处于“开启”位置的机器。他们被无意识的信念所驱动，坚信完美会让他们安全并受人喜爱。他们急于实现目标。他们在思考\[痴迷\]上的急迫程度不亚于行动\[强迫\]。

As children, flight types variably respond to their family trauma on a hyperactive continuum. The flight defense continuum stretches between the extremes of the driven “A” student and the ADHD \[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder\] dropout running amok. Flight types relentlessly flee the inner pain of their abandonment with the symbolic flight of constant busyness.

作为孩子，飞行类型对家庭创伤的反应在过度活跃的连续体上各不相同。飞行防御连续体从被驱动的“优秀”学生到四处乱跑的 ADHD\[注意力缺陷多动障碍\]辍学生这两个极端。飞行类型不断用象征性的忙碌逃避被遗弃的内心痛苦。
