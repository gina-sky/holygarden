健康自我关系的飞行 ![](books/复杂性%20PTSD/images/00002.jpeg) 冻结连续体

A healthy relationship with yourself is seen in your ability to move in a balanced way\[1\] between doing and being, \[2\] between persistence and letting go, \[3\] between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activation, and \[4\] between intense focus and relaxed, daydreamy reverie.

健康的自我关系体现在你能够在做和做之间、坚持和放手之间、交感神经和副交感神经系统的激活之间，以及集中精力和放松、梦幻般的幻想之间，以平衡的方式移动\[1\]。
