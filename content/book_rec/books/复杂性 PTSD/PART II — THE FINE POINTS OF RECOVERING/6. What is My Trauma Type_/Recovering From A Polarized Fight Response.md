**Recovering From A Polarized Fight Response  
  
从两极化的战斗反应中恢复**

I agree with the widely held notion that extreme narcissists and sociopaths are untreatable. Typically they are convinced that they themselves are perfect and that everyone else the problem.  
  
我同意广泛持有的观点，即极端自恋者和精神病患者是无法治疗的。通常他们坚信自己完美无缺，而其他人都是问题所在。

Fight types who are not true narcissists, however, benefit from understanding the costly price they pay for controlling others with intimidation, criticism and sarcasm. Some who I worked with eventually saw how their aggressive behavior scared away their potential intimates. One survivor also realized that although her partner stayed, he was so afraid and resentful of her demandingness and irritability, that he could not manifest the warmth or real liking that she so desperately desired.  
  
与并非真正的自恋型人格的战斗者相比，了解他们通过恐吓、批评和讽刺来控制他人所付出的高昂代价是有益的。我合作过的某些人最终意识到，他们的攻击性行为吓跑了他们的潜在亲密对象。一位幸存者也意识到，尽管她的伴侣留了下来，但他对她苛刻和易怒感到如此恐惧和怨恨，以至于他无法表现出她如此渴望的温暖或真实喜爱。

[[null|]]I have also helped a number of fight types understand the downward spiral of power and alienation that comes from being over-controlling. It looks like this: excessive use of power triggers a fearful emotional withdrawal in the other, which makes the fight type feel even more abandoned. In turn, he becomes more outraged and contemptuous, which then further distances his “intimate”. This once again increases the fight type’s rage and disgust, which then creates increasing distance and the withholding of warmth, ad infinitum.  
  
我还帮助许多战斗者理解了过度控制带来的权力和疏离的恶性循环。它看起来是这样的：过度使用权力会触发对方的恐惧情绪退缩，这使战斗者感到更加被遗弃。反过来，他会更加愤怒和轻蔑，这进一步疏远了他们的“亲密”关系。这再次增加了战斗者的愤怒和厌恶，进而创造了越来越多的距离和温暖保留，无休止地循环。

Fight types benefit from learning to redirect their rage toward the awful childhood circumstances that caused them to adopt such an intimacy-destroying defense. This can help them to deconstruct their habits of instantly morphing abandonment feelings into rage and disgust.  
  
战斗型人格通过学习将愤怒转向导致他们采取这种破坏亲密关系的防御机制的糟糕童年经历中受益。这可以帮助他们分解将被遗弃的感觉瞬间转化为愤怒和厌恶的习惯。

As the recovering fight type becomes more conscious of his abandonment feelings, he can learn to release his fear and shame with tears. I have helped several fight types by guiding them to cry to release their hurt, rather than always polarizing to angering it out. When we are hurt, part of us is sad and part of us is mad, and no amount of angering can ever metabolize our sadness.  
  
随着恢复中的战斗型人格越来越意识到自己的被遗弃感，他们可以学会通过哭泣来释放恐惧和羞愧。我曾帮助过几个战斗型人格，通过引导他们哭泣来释放痛苦，而不是总是将愤怒转化为愤怒的爆发。当我们受伤时，我们的一部分是悲伤的，另一部分是愤怒的，无论愤怒多少都无法消化我们的悲伤。

Fight types need to see how their condescending, moral high-ground position alienates others and perpetuates their present time abandonment. They must renounce the illusion of their own perfection and the habit of projecting perfectionistic inner critic processes onto others. This is the work of shrinking the Outer Critic as we will see in [[10. Shrinking the Outer Critic|chapter 10]].  
  
战斗型人格需要看到他们的优越感和道德制高点如何使他人疏远，并持续他们现在的被遗弃状态。他们必须放弃自己完美的幻想，以及将完美主义内在批评过程投射到他人身上的习惯。这就是我们在第 10 章中将看到的缩小外在批评者的工作。

Fight types also benefit from learning to take self-initiated timeouts whenever they notice that they are triggered and feeling overcritical. Timeouts can then be used to redirect the lion’s share of their hurt feelings into grieving and working through their original [[null|]]abandonment, rather than displacing it destructively onto current intimates.  
  
战斗型的人也可以通过学习在意识到自己被触发并感到过度批判时主动休息，从而受益。然后，他们可以用休息时间将大部分受伤的感觉转化为哀悼和解决他们最初的被遗弃问题，而不是将这种伤害破坏性地转移到当前的亲密关系上。

Furthermore, like all 4F fixations, fight types need to become more flexible and adaptable in using the other 4F responses. If you are a recovering fight type, it will especially benefit you to learn the empathy response of the fawn position. Begin by trying to imagine how it feels to be the person you are interacting with. Do it as much as you can. Moreover, you can expand on this by developing mindfulness about the needs, rights and feelings of those with whom you would like to have real intimacy.  
  
此外，就像所有 4F 固着一样，战斗型的人需要在使用其他 4F 反应时变得更加灵活和适应。如果你是一个正在恢复的战斗型，学习鹿角位置的同情反应将特别有益。首先，尝试想象你正在与之互动的人的感受。尽可能多地这样做。此外，你可以通过培养对那些你希望与之建立真正亲密关系的人的需求、权利和感受的觉察来扩展这一点。

In early recovery you can “fake it until you make it.” For without practicing consideration for the other, and without reciprocity and dialogicality \[as opposed to monologing\], the intimacy you crave will allude you.  
  
在早期恢复阶段，你可以“假装做到你做到”。因为没有练习对别人的考虑，没有互惠和对话性（而不是独白），你渴望的亲密关系将遥不可及。
