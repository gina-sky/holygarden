\*\*Fawn-Fight: Smother Mother

亲爱之战：溺爱母亲\*\*

The recommendations in the last two paragraphs also apply to many of those survivors who are fawn-fight types. Some can be quite aggressive in their attempts to help others. Typically they equate helping with changing, and can alienate others by persistently pressuring them to take their advice.

最后两段中的建议也适用于许多那些属于亲爱之战类型的幸存者。有些人试图帮助他人时可能会非常激进。通常，他们将帮助等同于改变，并通过持续地施压，让他们接受自己的建议，从而疏远他人。

The fawn-fight type is the smother-love caretaker. Her care-taking approach of being over-focused on the other is sometimes a repetition of her childhood servant role. Moreover, her helpfulness is usually less self-serving than the fight-fawn that we discussed in the last chapter. Nonetheless, the zealousness of her caretaking sometimes makes the recipient believe it when she says “I just love you to death.”

亲爱之战类型是溺爱型照顾者。她对他人过度关注的照顾方式有时是她童年仆人角色的重复。此外，她的帮助通常比上一章中讨论的战斗型亲爱更少自私。然而，她照顾的狂热有时会让接受者相信当她说她“爱你爱到死”时。

In flashback, the fawn-fight can deteriorate into manipulative or even coercive care-taking. He can smother love the other into conforming to his view of who she should be.

在回忆中，小鹿般的争斗可能会恶化成操纵甚至强迫性的照顾。他可能会将爱压制成让对方遵从他的观点，即她应该成为的样子。

Fawn-fight types may periodically reach a critical mass of frustration that erupts when the “patient” refuses his advice or balks at his unwanted caretaking. Sometimes the fawn-fight feels an entitlement to punish the other “for their own good”, especially in a primary relationship.

小鹿般的争斗类型可能会周期性地积累到临界点的挫败感，当“病人”拒绝他的建议或对他的不请自来的照顾表示抗拒时，这种挫败感会爆发。有时，小鹿般的争斗会觉得自己有权“为了对方的利益”惩罚对方，尤其是在主要关系中。

The fawn-fight is sometimes misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder \[BPD\]. This is because the fawn-fight can be emotionally intense during flashbacks. When triggered into a panicky [[null|]]sense of abandonment, he feels desperate for love and can vacillate dramatically between clawing for it or flatteringly groveling for it. He does not however have the core narcissism of the true borderline that we looked at in the [[6. What is My Trauma Type_|previous chapter]].

小鹿般的争斗有时会被误诊为边缘型人格障碍\[BPD\]。这是因为小鹿般的争斗在回忆中可能会情绪激烈。当被触发到被遗弃的恐慌感时，他会感到对爱的绝望，可以在拼命争取爱和谄媚地乞求爱之间剧烈摇摆。然而，他并没有我们在上一章中讨论的真正边缘型人格的核心自恋。

Another distinction between these two types is that fawn-fight type seeks real intimacy. She is the most relational hybrid and most susceptible to love addiction. She stands in contradistinction to the fight-fawn who is more addicted to physical release, and hence more susceptible to sex addiction.

这两种类型之间的另一个区别是，小鹿般的争斗类型寻求真正的亲密。她是关系型混合体中最具关系性和最容易上瘾于爱情的人。她与更沉迷于身体释放的争斗型小鹿形成对比，因此更容易上瘾于性。
