\*\*Grieving Through Codependence

通过共依存来哀悼\*\*

I usually find that deconstructing codependence involves a considerable amount of grieving. Typically this entails many tears about the loss and pain of being so long without healthy self-interest and self-protection. Grieving also unlocks healthy anger about a life lived with such a diminished sense of self.

我通常发现，分解共依存涉及大量的哀悼。这通常包括许多关于失去健康自我利益和自我保护的痛苦和眼泪。哀悼还释放了关于过着如此自我意识减弱的生活的健康的愤怒。

This anger can then be used to build a healthy fight response. Once again, the fight response is the basis of the instinct of self-protection, of balanced assertiveness, and of the courage that is needed to make relationships equal and reciprocal.

这种愤怒可以用来构建健康的战斗反应。再次强调，战斗反应是自我保护本能、平衡的自信和建立平等互惠关系所需勇气的基石。
