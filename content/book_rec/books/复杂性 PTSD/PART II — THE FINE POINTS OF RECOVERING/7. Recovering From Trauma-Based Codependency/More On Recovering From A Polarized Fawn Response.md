**MORE ON RECOVERING FROM A POLARIZED FAWN RESPONSE  
  
更多关于从极化鹿反应中恢复的内容**

Psychoeducation about their parents’ role in creating their fawn response has helped many of my clients. Many instantly grasped that their codependence comes from having been continuously attacked and shamed as selfish for even the most basic level of healthy self-interest.  
  
关于他们的父母在创造他们的鹿反应中所扮演的角色进行心理教育已经帮助了许多我的客户。许多客户立刻意识到，他们的相互依赖性源于他们一直被攻击和羞辱，甚至因为最基本的健康自我利益而被视为自私。

One fortyish client estimated that she had scorned herself as “selfish” countless times, until one night she had the epiphany that she was by far not selfish enough. This occurred while she was reading the comments of respondents to a website for adult children of narcissistic mothers \[ www.narcissisticmothers.org \]. Suddenly she realized that her mother was the one with a monopoly on self-interest in her family. My client then realized that every time she thought of doing something for herself, she not only felt very anxious, but also ashamed that she was acting as ghastly as her mother.  
  
一位四十多岁的客户估计，她无数次地贬低自己为“自私”，直到有一天晚上她突然顿悟，她远远不够自私。这件事发生在她阅读一个针对自恋型母亲成年子女的网站上的回应者评论时\[ www.narcissisticmothers.org \]。突然她意识到，她的母亲是她家庭中自我利益的垄断者。我的客户随后意识到，每次她想到为自己做点什么，她不仅感到非常焦虑，还感到羞耻，因为她觉得自己表现得像她母亲一样可怕。

Fawns need to understand that fear of being attacked for lapses in ingratiation causes them to forfeit their boundaries, rights and needs. Understanding this dynamic is a necessary but not sufficient step in recovery. There are many codependents who realize [[null|]]their penchant for forfeiting themselves, but who instantly forget everything they know when self-assertion is appropriate in their relationships.  
  
鹿需要明白，因害怕因未能讨好而受到攻击，导致它们放弃了自己的界限、权利和需求。理解这种动态是恢复过程中必要但不充分的步骤。有许多共依存者意识到自己放弃自我的倾向，但在他们关系中适当地自我主张时，他们会立刻忘记所有已知的一切。

In early recovery, I became increasingly aware in new dating situations of how much I was over-eliciting my date. Eventually, I was struck by how little I had to say for myself, but I found it very difficult to break the pattern.  
  
在早期恢复期间，我在新的约会场合中越来越意识到自己过度引起对方的注意。最终，我惊讶于自己竟然如此少有自我表达，但我发现很难打破这种模式。

Over time, I realized that my intention to be more forthcoming was frightening me into a flashback. This made me dissociate and forget everything I had planned to say. All I could think to do, when an amygdala hijacking took my left-brain off line, was to get my date talking. I then regressed to the tried and true safety position of listening and eliciting.  
  
随着时间的推移，我意识到我想要更加坦率的意图让我害怕得回到了过去。这让我分心，忘记了原本打算说的话。当杏仁核劫持让我的左脑离线时，我能想到的唯一办法就是让我的约会对象说话。然后我退回到了听和引出话题的既定安全位置。

It wasn’t until my therapist recommended that I write down some key words on my palm that I began to master the situation. Looking at the words brought my left-brain back online, and I gradually got better at holding up my end of the getting-to-know-you conversation.  
  
直到我的治疗师建议我在手掌上写下一些关键词，我才开始掌握局势。看着这些词让我的左脑重新在线，我逐渐变得擅长在了解彼此的对话中承担我的部分。

Much later, I had the realization: “No wonder I wind up with one narcissist after another. Narcissists love me because I am so enabling of their monologing. I probably met lots of nice balanced people who did not want another date with me because it seemed like I was hiding and hard to get to know.”  
  
后来，我有了这样的认识：“难怪我总是遇到一个又一个自恋者。自恋者喜欢我，因为我如此纵容他们的独白。我可能遇到了很多好的人，他们不想再和我约会，因为我觉得我在躲藏，很难了解。”

Around this time I also had a fawn type friend who had the same problem. She liked to joke that her listening and eliciting defenses where so perfected that she could turn anyone, even a blank-screen therapist, into a monologing narcissist.  
  
在这个时候，我还有一个有同样问题的鹿型朋友。她喜欢开玩笑说，她的倾听和激发防御机制如此完美，以至于她可以把任何人，甚至一个白板治疗师，变成一个独白自恋者。

To break free of their codependence, survivors must learn to stay present to the fear that triggers the self-abdication of the fawn response. In the face of their fear, they must try on and practice an expanding repertoire of more functional responses to fear. \[See the flashback management steps in the [[8.

为了摆脱他们的相互依赖，幸存者必须学会面对触发鹿型反应的恐惧，并尝试和实践更多更有效的应对恐惧的方法。\[参见下一章中的闪回管理步骤\]
