\*\*“Disapproval Is Okay With Me”

“我不介意反对”\*\*

Early in recovery, an esteemed mentor gave me the affirmation “Disapproval is okay with me.” Codependently, I enthusiastically welcomed his advice that I should practice it until it was true. Privately I thought “Surely you jest!” I had survived the previous thirty years with a Will Rogers-like mission to prove that “I never met a man I didn’t like.”

在康复初期，一位受人尊敬的导师给了我这样的肯定：“我不需要别人的赞同。”我盲目地接受了他的建议，应该练习直到这句话成为事实。私下里我想：“你肯定是在开玩笑！”我以前三十年的使命就像威尔·罗杰斯一样，要证明“我从未遇到过我不喜欢的人。”

I did not yet know that I had unconsciously gravitated to this all-or-none nonsense because I was somewhat desperately trying to seduce everyone I met into liking me in the hope that I could finally feel safe.

我不知道自己不知不觉地被这种非黑即白的不合理想法所吸引，因为我急切地试图让遇到的每个人都喜欢我，希望最终能感到安全。

As I thought further about this affirmation, I judged it as patently absurd and eminently unachievable. Yet within a week something ignited in me that really wanted it to become true.

当我进一步思考这个肯定时，我认为它显然是荒谬的，而且根本无法实现。然而，在一周内，我内心燃起了一股强烈的愿望，希望它成为现实。

Since it was still a long time before I knew anything about code-pendence, it took almost two decades to make any progress at all. The importance of learning to handle and accept disapproval faded in and out of my awareness myriad times.

由于我对代码依赖性一无所知，要取得任何进展几乎花了近二十年的时间。学会处理和接受批评的重要性在我的意识中时隐时现。

But now as I write thirty years later, I feel it is one of the most important things I have ever learned. I rest most of the time in receiving so much approval from my friends and intimates that I [[null|]]can usually let in their constructive feedback fairly easily. As a corollary to this, I rarely care what people think about me who I do not know or who do not know me.

但现在，当我写下三十年后的今天，我觉得这是我学过的最重要的事情之一。我大部分时间都在接受朋友和亲密的人给予的很多认可，我通常可以很容易地接受他们的建设性反馈。作为这一点的推论，我对那些我不认识或他们不认识我的人的看法很少关心。

And, of course, this is not a perfect accomplishment. Disapproval can still on occasion trigger me into a flashback. But it delights me to report that I now experience most disapproval with considerable equanimity. I even occasionally experience some people’s disapproval as a good thing. Sometimes it is a validation that I am doing the right thing and evolving in the right direction. Nowhere is this truer than with the disapproval of the narcissistic parents or partners of clients whom I am working to rescue from their enslavement. Their disapproval of me is actually an affirmation that I have indeed been involved in right action.

当然，这并不是完美的成就。有时，不赞同仍会让我产生闪回。但让我高兴的是，我现在大多数时候都能以相当平和的心态接受不赞同。甚至有时我会把某些人的不赞同看作是好事。有时这证明我正在做正确的事，朝着正确的方向前进。这一点在处理那些被父母或伴侣奴役的客户时尤为明显。他们对我的不赞同实际上是对我采取正确行动的肯定。

Most of the time, disapproval _is_ okay with me.

大多数时候，我不赞同是可以接受的。
