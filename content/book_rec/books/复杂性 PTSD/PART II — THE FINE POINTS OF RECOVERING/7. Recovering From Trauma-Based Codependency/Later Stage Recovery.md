\*\*Later Stage Recovery

后期康复阶段\*\*

To facilitate the reclaiming of assertiveness, I encourage the survivor to imagine herself confronting a current or past unfairness. This type of role-playing is often delicate work, as it can invoke a therapeutic flashback that brings up old fear.

为了促进自信心的恢复，我鼓励幸存者想象自己面对当前或过去的不公平。这种角色扮演通常很微妙，因为它可能会引发治疗性闪回，唤起旧有的恐惧。

[[null|]]As the survivor learns to stay present in assertiveness role-plays, she becomes more aware of how fear triggers her into fawning. She can then practice staying present to her fear and acting assertively anyway.

随着幸存者学会在自信的情景模拟中保持当下，她开始更加意识到恐惧是如何触发她谄媚的。然后她可以练习在恐惧中保持当下，并依然采取自信的行为。

With enough practice she then heals the developmental arrest of not having learned “to feel the fear and do it anyway.” This in turn sets the stage for deconstructing self-harmful reactions to fear like giving or compromising too much. Moreover, it makes the survivor more adept at flashback management.

通过足够的练习，她然后治愈了没有学会“感受恐惧并继续前行”的发展停滞。这反过来为分解对恐惧的自我伤害反应，如给予或妥协过多，奠定了基础。此外，它使幸存者更擅长处理闪回。

As later stage recovery progresses, the survivor increasingly “knows her own mind”. She slowly dissolves the habit of reflexively agreeing with other people’s preferences and opinions. She more easily expresses her own point of view and makes her own choices. And most importantly, she learns to stay inside herself.

随着后期康复的进展，幸存者越来越“了解自己的想法”。她逐渐摆脱了无意识地同意他人喜好和观点的习惯。她更容易表达自己的观点并做出自己的选择。最重要的是，她学会了待在自己的内心。

Many fawns survived by _constantly_ focusing their awareness on their parents to figure out what was needed to appease them. Some became almost psychic in their ability to read their parents moods and expectations. This then helped them to figure out the best response to neutralize parental danger. For some, it even occasionally won them some approval.

许多小鹿通过不断关注父母，了解满足他们需求的方法而幸存下来。一些小鹿几乎具有通灵的能力，能够读懂父母的心情和期望。这帮助他们找到最佳的反应来消除父母的危险。对于一些人来说，这甚至偶尔能赢得他们的认可。

Survivors now need to deconstruct this habit by working to stay more inside their own experience without constantly projecting their attention outward to read others. Fawn-types who are still habituated to people-pleasing, must work on reducing their ingratiating behaviors. I have noticed over the years that the degree to which a survivor strains to please me reflects the degree to which his parents were dangerous.

幸存者现在需要通过努力保持在自己的体验中，而不是不断将注意力投射出去去阅读他人，来打破这种习惯。那些仍然习惯于取悦他人的人，必须努力减少他们的奉承行为。多年来，我发现，幸存者为了取悦我而做出的努力程度，反映了他们父母危险的程度。

Recovering requires us to become increasingly mindful of our automatic matching and mirroring behaviors. This helps us decrease the habit of reflexively agreeing with everything that anyone says.

恢复需要我们越来越关注我们的自动匹配和镜像行为。这有助于我们减少对任何人说的任何事都无意识地表示同意的习惯。

It is a great accomplishment to significantly reduce verbal matching. It is an even more powerful achievement to reduce inauthentic emotional mirroring.

显著减少言语匹配是一个巨大的成就。减少不真诚的情感镜像则是一个更强大的成就。

[[null|]]Dysfunctional emotional matching is seen in behaviors such as acting amused at destructive sarcasm, acting loving when someone is punishing, and acting forgiving when someone is repetitively hurtful.

功能失调的情感匹配体现在以下行为中：在别人进行破坏性的讽刺时表现得开心，在别人惩罚时表现得爱意满满，在别人反复伤害时表现得宽容。

I call this emotional individuation work. As such, recovery involves setting the kind of boundaries that help us to stay true to our own actual emotional experience.

我把这称为情感个体化工作。因此，康复过程包括设定那些帮助我们保持真实情感体验的界限。

In advanced recovery, this occurs when we reduce the habit of automatically shifting our mood to match someone else’s emotional state. By this, I do not mean suppressing empathic attunement when it is genuine. Crying and laughing along with an intimate is a truly wonderful experience.

在高级康复阶段，这发生在我们减少自动调整情绪以匹配他人情感状态的习惯时。我并不是说在真诚的共情调谐时进行压制。与亲密的人一起哭泣和欢笑是一种真正美好的体验。

Rather, what I am recommending here is resisting the pressure to pretend you are always feeling the same as someone else. You do not have to laugh when something is not funny. When a friend is feeling bad, you do not have to act like you feel bad. When you are feeling bad, you do not have to act like you feel happy.

而我在这里推荐的是，抵制假装你总是与他人感受相同的压力。当事情并不好笑时，你不必笑。当朋友感到难过时，你不必表现得你也感到难过。当你感到难过时，你不必表现得你感到快乐。

Thankfully, I learned a great deal about this from being a therapist. When my client is depressed, it does not help him if I adjust my mood and act depressed.

幸亏，作为一名治疗师，我对此有了很多了解。当我的客户抑郁时，如果我调整自己的情绪表现得也抑郁，这并不能帮助他。

Yet I am always genuinely empathic toward my client’s depression, because I can put myself in his shoes via my own experiences of depression. I can be there caringly for him without abandoning my own feeling of contentment in the moment.

然而，我对客户的抑郁始终抱有真正的同理心，因为通过我自己的抑郁经历，我能设身处地地为他着想。我可以在他需要的时候给予关怀，同时不放弃自己在当下的满足感。

Similarly I can be feeling depressed while you are enthused about something and genuinely appreciate your happiness without shamefully abandoning my temporarily depressed self.

同样，当我感到抑郁而你对此事充满热情时，我也能真诚地欣赏你的快乐，而不会因为羞愧而放弃我暂时的抑郁状态。

Here is another example of this. You are in a great mood and tell me that you loved this old musical that you just saw. I, however, am feeling down and dislike old musicals. If I were a fight type, the table would be set for a great deal of mutual alienation.

这里有一个类似的例子。你心情很好，告诉我你非常喜欢刚刚看的那部老音乐剧。然而，我却感到沮丧，不喜欢老音乐剧。如果我是那种好斗的人，我们之间就会有很大的隔阂。

If I were an unrecovered fawn type, however, I might strangle my bad mood and my musical taste, and anxiously squeeze out a [[null|]]high-pitched, forced frivolity about how wonderful Fred Astaire is. Instead, I can reach for a deeper more authentic truth. I can let you know that I am pleased you had such a nice time. After all, I really believe in different strokes for different folks.

如果我是那种无法恢复的幼鹿类型，然而，我可能会扼杀我的坏心情和我的音乐品味，焦急地挤出一种高音调、勉强的轻佻，关于弗雷德·阿斯泰尔多么了不起。相反，我可以追求更深更真实的真理。我可以让你知道我很高兴你玩得这么开心。毕竟，我真的相信因人而异。

As I write this, I flash on Bruno, a dear old hospice client of mine. During a visit, with him, he told me: “I can’t stand talking to that new volunteer. She acts so morose whenever she visits me. I mean, who the hell’s dying here… me or her? I tell ya I don’t know who is worse – her or that other smiley volunteer, the one who always acts like she just walked into Disneyland.”

当我写这篇东西的时候，我脑海中闪现出布鲁诺，我的一位亲爱的老临终关怀客户。在一次拜访中，他对我说：“我无法忍受和那个新志愿者交谈。她每次来拜访我时都表现得如此忧郁。我的意思是，谁在这里等死……是我还是她？我告诉你，我不知道谁更糟糕——是她还是那个总是笑眯眯的志愿者，那个总是表现得好像刚走进迪士尼乐园的人。”
