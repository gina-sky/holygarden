\*\*Fawn-Flight: Super Nurse

鹿飞：超级护士\*\*

The fawn-flight type is most typically seen in the busyholic parent, nurse or administrative assistant who works from dawn until bedtime providing for the needs of the household, hospital or company. He compulsively takes care of everyone else’s needs with hardly a gesture toward his own.

鹿奔型通常见于忙碌的父母、护士或行政助理，他们从黎明工作到夜晚，满足家庭、医院或公司的需求。他强迫自己照顾他人的需求，几乎不关心自己的需求。

The fawn-flight is sometimes a misguided Mother Teresa type, who escapes the pain of her self-abandonment by seeing herself as the perfect, selfless caregiver. She further distances herself from her own pain by obsessive-compulsively rushing from one person in need to another.

小鹿奔逃有时是一种误入歧途的特蕾莎修女式人物，她们通过将自己视为完美、无私的照顾者来逃避自我放弃的痛苦。她们通过强迫性地从一个需要帮助的人奔向另一个，进一步将自己与自己的痛苦隔离开来。

Some fawn-flight clients also become OCD-like clean-aholics. One of my interns told me that her fawn-flight client had a dozen color-coded tooth brushes for various micro-cleaning tasks in her family’s bathroom and kitchen.

一些小鹿奔逃的客户也变成了强迫性洁癖者。我的一个实习生告诉我，她的一个客户在她的家庭浴室和厨房里有一打不同颜色的牙刷，用于各种微清洁任务。

Some fawn-flights project their perfectionism on others. They can appoint themselves as honorary advisers, and overburden others with their advice. However, it behooves fawn-flights to learn that caring is not always about fixing. This is especially true when the person we are trying to help is in emotional pain. Many times all that person needs is empathy, acceptance and an opportunity to verbally ventilate. Moreover some mood states also need time to resolve. Loving people when they are feeling bad is a powerful kind of caring.

一些小鹿奔逃者将自己的完美主义投射到他人身上。他们可以自封为荣誉顾问，并给他人带来沉重的建议负担。然而，小鹿奔逃者应该明白，关爱并不总是关于解决问题的。当我们试图帮助的人处于情感痛苦中时，这一点尤其正确。很多时候，那个人需要的只是同情、接受和口头宣泄的机会。此外，一些情绪状态也需要时间来解决。在他们感到糟糕时给予关爱是一种强大的关爱方式。

[[null|]]The above also relates to allowing others to be imperfect. We all have minor limitations and foibles that may not be transformable. Loved ones need to be spared from being pressured to fix what is unfixable. My way of approaching this is to always frame my advice as take-it or leave-it. To prove this is so, I refrain from then going on about it repetitively. Additionally, I typically check in first to see if the other person actually wants some feedback.

以上也涉及到允许他人不完美。我们都有一些小局限和缺点，可能无法改变。亲人需要被免于被压力去修复无法修复的事情。我处理这个问题的方法是将我的建议总是以“接受或放弃”的方式提出。为了证明这一点，我不会反复地继续说下去。此外，我通常会先检查一下，看看对方是否真的想要一些反馈。
