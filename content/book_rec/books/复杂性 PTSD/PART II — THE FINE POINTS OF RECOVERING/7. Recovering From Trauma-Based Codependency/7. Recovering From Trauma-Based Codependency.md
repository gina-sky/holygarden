RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY  
  
从创伤性共依存中恢复

If you assessed yourself in the last chapter as a fawn subtype or as being on the right side of the fight ![](content/book_rec/books/复杂性%20PTSD/images/00002.jpeg) fawn spectrum, you may find this chapter relevant even if the fawn response is not your primary position. Moreover the first section below contains important information about the origins of all types.  
  
如果你在上一个章节中评估自己为鹿型子型或处于鹿型战斗谱的右侧，即使鹿型反应不是你的主要位置，你可能也会觉得这一章相关。此外，下面第一部分包含有关所有类型起源的重要信息。

I have dedicated a whole chapter to codependency because it is the 4F trauma response that I know the most about. This knowledge comes from my own personal recovery journey, and from specializing in treating codependency for over two decades.  
  
我专门用了一章来讲述共依存，因为这是我最了解的 4F 创伤反应。这种知识来源于我自己的个人恢复之旅，以及我专注于治疗共依存超过二十年的专业经验。

I wrote the gist of this chapter one satori-blessed night when I noticed that I anxiously apologized to a chair that I had bumped [[null|]]into. I think I probably apologized to inanimate objects many times before in my life, but this was the first time I noticed it.  
  
我在一个开悟之夜写下了这一章的要点，那天我注意到我焦虑地向一个我撞到的椅子道歉。我想我以前可能多次向无生命物体道歉，但这是第一次注意到这一点。

Realizing that I had just apologized to a chair suddenly made me feel enraged. I felt furious that something had happened to me to give me a Pavlovian “I’m sorry” response.  
  
意识到自己刚刚向一把椅子道歉，这突然让我感到愤怒。我愤怒地觉得，有什么事情发生在我身上，让我产生了巴甫洛夫式的“对不起”反应。

I had been pursuing family of origin exploration for quite some time, and the accumulated evidence quickly convinced me that my parents deeply imprinted me with a fawn response. I was brainwashed with a default program to ingratiatingly apologize when anything in the natural order of things changed around me.  
  
我已经追求原生家庭探索很长时间了，积累的证据很快让我相信，我的父母深深地在我心中留下了鹿的反应印记。我被洗脑了，默认程序是在周围的自然秩序发生变化时，谄媚地道歉。

Sudden anxiety responses to apparently innocuous circumstances like my example are often emotional flashbacks to earlier traumatic events. Sometimes a current event can have only the vaguest resemblance to a past traumatic situation, and this can be enough to trigger the psyche’s hard-wiring for a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response.  
  
对我的例子等看似无害的情况产生突然的焦虑反应，通常是情感上的闪回，回到了早期的创伤事件。有时，当前的事件可能与过去的创伤情况只有微弱的相似之处，这足以触发心理上的战斗、逃跑、冻结或鹿的反应机制。

In this case I fawned to the chair, subliminally experiencing it as a dangerous parent and codependently apologizing to it like a toddler anticipating punishment for touching something forbidden. As I free-associated on this I also realized that I was addicted to apologizing. I had apologized for long traffic lights, for changes in the weather, and most especially for other people’s mistakes and bad moods.  
  
在这种情况下，我向椅子谄媚，潜意识里把它当作一个危险的家长，像小孩因为触摸了禁止的东西而期待惩罚一样，向它道歉。在我自由联想这个话题时，我也意识到我沉迷于道歉。我为漫长的红灯、天气的变化道歉，尤其是为别人的错误和坏心情道歉。
