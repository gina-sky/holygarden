**COMPARING FAWN ORIGINS WITH FIGHT, FLIGHT AND FREEZE ORIGINS  
  
比较谄媚的起源与战斗、逃跑和冻结的起源**

I chose the name fawn for the fourth ‘F’ in the fight/flight/freeze/fawn typology, because according to Webster, it means: “to act servilely; to cringe and flatter”. I believe it is this response that is at the core of many codependents’ behavior.  
  
我选择“fawn”（谄媚）这个名字作为战斗/逃跑/冻结/谄媚类型中的第四个“F”，因为根据韦伯斯特词典，它的意思是：“表现得卑躬屈膝；卑躬屈膝地奉承”。我相信这种反应是许多共依存者行为的核心。

As a toddler, the codependent learns quickly that protesting abuse leads to even more frightening parental retaliation. Thus she [[null|]]responds by relinquishing her fight response, deleting “no” from her vocabulary and never developing the language skills of healthy assertiveness.  
  
作为一个小孩，共依存者很快就会学到，抗议虐待只会招致更可怕的家长报复。因此，她通过放弃战斗反应，从她的词汇中删除“不”，并且从未发展出健康的坚定性语言技能。

Moreover, many abusive parents reserve their most harsh punishments for “talking back”, and hence ruthlessly extinguish the fight response in their children. Unfortunately, this typically happens at such an early age that they later have little or no memory of it.  
  
此外，许多虐待孩子的父母将最严厉的惩罚保留给“顶嘴”，因此无情地熄灭了孩子体内的战斗反应。不幸的是，这种情况通常发生在非常早的年龄，以至于他们后来几乎没有记忆。

The future codependent also learns early on that her natural flight response intensifies her danger if she tries to flee. “I’ll teach you to run away from me!” is a common response that precedes the spanking typically awarded to such behavior.  
  
未来的共依存者也很早就学会了，如果她试图逃跑，她的自然逃跑反应会加剧危险。“我要让你学会离我远去！”这是通常在体罚之前的一个常见反应。

Later, when the child is older she may also learn that the ultimate flight response, running away from home, is hopelessly impractical and even more danger-laden. Traumatizing families, however, seem to be on the rise, as there is an epidemic of children \[as young as pre-teens\] becoming runaways and ending up in dire circumstances.  
  
后来，当孩子长大一些，她可能也会了解到，最终的逃跑反应——离家出走，是毫无希望的不可行，甚至更加危险。然而，创伤性的家庭似乎在增加，因为儿童（甚至青少年）成为离家出走者，并陷入困境的情况正在成为一种流行病。

Many toddlers, at some point, transmute the flight urge into the running around in circles of hyperactivity. This adaptation “works” on some level to help them escape from the uncontainable feelings of the abandonment mélange. Many of these unfortunates later symbolically run away from their pain. They deteriorate into the obsessive-compulsive adaptations of workaholism, busyholism, spend-aholism, and sex and love addiction that are common in flight types.  
  
许多幼儿在某个阶段，将逃避的冲动转化为过度活跃地绕圈跑。这种适应方式在某些层面上“有效”，帮助他们逃离无法控制的被遗弃感。这些不幸的人中，许多人后来象征性地逃离了他们的痛苦。他们堕落为工作狂、忙碌狂、消费狂以及性爱和爱情成瘾等逃避型人格的强迫性适应。

The toddler who bypasses the adaptation of the flight defense may drift into developing the freeze response and become the “lost child.” This child escapes his fear by slipping more and more deeply into dissociation. He learns to let his parents’ verbal and emotional abuse “go in one ear and out the other.” It is not uncommon for this type to devolve in adolescence into the numbing substance addictions of pot, alcohol, opiates and other “downers”.  
  
那些绕过逃避防御适应的幼儿可能会陷入发展冻结反应，成为“迷失的孩子”。这个孩子通过越来越深地陷入解离来逃避他的恐惧。他学会让父母的言语和情感虐待“左耳进右耳出”。这种类型的人在青春期退化成大麻、酒精、鸦片和其他“镇静剂”的麻木物质成瘾并不罕见。

[[null|]]The future codependent toddler, however, wisely gives up on the fight, flight and freeze responses. Instead she learns to fawn her way into the occasional safety of being perceived as helpful. It bears repeating that the fawn type is often one of the gifted children that Alice Miller writes about in _The Drama Of The Gifted Child_. She is the precocious one who discovers that a modicum of safety can be purchased by becoming variously useful to her parent.  
  
未来的共生型幼儿却明智地放弃了战斗、逃跑和冻结的反应。相反，她学会了通过取悦的方式进入偶尔的安全感，即被视为有用。有必要重复一点，鹿型的人通常是艾丽丝·米勒在《天才儿童的戏剧》中提到的有天赋的孩子之一。她是早熟的孩子，发现通过以各种方式对父母有用，可以买到一定程度的保障。

Servitude, ingratiation, and obsequiousness become important survival strategies. She cleverly forfeits all needs that might inconvenience her parents. She stops having preferences and opinions that might anger them. Boundaries of every kind are surrendered to mollify her parents, who repudiate their duty of caring for her. As we saw in the last chapter, she is often parentified and becomes as thoroughly helpful to the parent as she can.  
  
服从、谄媚和卑躬屈膝成为重要的生存策略。她巧妙地放弃所有可能让父母不便的需求。她停止拥有可能激怒他们的偏好和观点。各种界限都被放弃，以安抚那些拒绝履行照顾她责任的父母。正如我们在上一章看到的，她经常被父母化，并尽可能地帮助父母。

I wonder how many therapists besides me were prepared for their careers in this way.  
  
我想知道有多少像我一样的治疗师为他们的职业生涯做了这样的准备。

All this loss of self begins before the child has many words, and certainly no insight. For the budding codependent, all hints of danger soon immediately trigger servile behaviors and abdication of rights and needs.  
  
所有这些自我丧失都在孩子学会很多词汇之前就开始了，当然也没有任何洞察力。对于萌芽期的共生型个体，所有危险的暗示很快就会立即触发服从行为和放弃权利和需求。

These response patterns are so deeply set in the psyche, that as adults, many codependents automatically respond to threat like dogs, symbolically rolling over on their backs, wagging their tails, hoping for a little mercy and an occasional scrap. Webster’s second entry for fawn is: “to show friendliness by licking hands, wagging its tail, etc.: said of a dog.” I find it tragic that some codependents are as loyal as dogs to even the worst “masters”.  
  
这些反应模式在心理上根深蒂固，以至于成年后，许多依赖性人格障碍者会像狗一样自动对威胁做出反应，象征性地翻过身来，摇着尾巴，希望得到一点仁慈和偶尔的残羹剩饭。韦伯斯特词典中关于“fawn”的第二条定义是：“通过舔手、摇尾巴等表现出友好：指狗。”我觉得有些依赖性人格障碍者对甚至是最糟糕的“主人”也像狗一样忠诚，这很悲哀。

Finally, I have noticed that extreme emotional abandonment, as described in [[5. What if I Was Never Hit_|chapter 5]], also creates this kind of codependency. The severely neglected child experiences extreme lack of connection as traumatic, and sometimes responds to this fearful condition by overdeveloping the fawn response. Once a child realizes that being useful and not requiring anything for herself gets her some [[null|]]positive attention from her parents, codependency begins to grow. It becomes an increasingly automatic habit over the years.  
  
最后，我注意到，第 5 章中描述的极端情感忽视也会产生这种依赖性。严重被忽视的孩子将极度缺乏联系视为创伤，有时会通过过度发展“fawn”反应来应对这种恐惧状态。一旦孩子意识到，有用且不需要为自己要求任何东西能从父母那里得到一些积极的关注，依赖性就开始增长。这种习惯在多年里变得越来越自动化。
