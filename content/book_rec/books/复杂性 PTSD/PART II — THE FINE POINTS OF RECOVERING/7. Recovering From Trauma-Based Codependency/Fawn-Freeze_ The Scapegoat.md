\*\*Fawn-Freeze: The Scapegoat

顺从-冻结：替罪羊\*\*

The fawn-freeze is typically the most codependently entrenched subtype. Not all scapegoats are fawn-freeze, but since fawn and freeze types are both prone to extreme self-denial, many end up in a scapegoat position.

顺从-冻结通常是共依存最根深蒂固的亚型。并非所有替罪羊都是顺从-冻结，但由于顺从和冻结类型都倾向于极端的自我否定，许多人最终处于替罪羊的位置。

This is also because these are the two most passive of the four F’s. They have both typically suffered the most punishment or rejection for asserting themselves in the toddler stage.

这还因为它们是四个 F 中最被动的两种。它们通常在幼儿阶段主张自己的权利时遭受了最多的惩罚或拒绝。

When the fawn-freeze is not able to escape the scapegoat role in childhood, she is then set up to be similarly victimized in adulthood.

当小鹿般的恐惧无法摆脱童年时的替罪羊角色时，她随后就会在成年后遭受类似的受害者待遇。

In worst case scenarios fawn-freezes are easily recognized by fight types who take them captive. They may then turn them into doormats and subject them to domestic violence \[DV\]. Sometimes, [[null|]]the fawn-freeze does not even recognize that she is being abused. Other times she blames herself \[as she had to in childhood\].

在最糟糕的情况下，小鹿般的恐惧很容易被那些捕捉他们的斗士识别。他们可能会将他们变成门垫，并让他们遭受家庭暴力\[DV\]。有时，小鹿般的恐惧甚至没有意识到自己正在遭受虐待。其他时候，她会责怪自己\[就像她在童年时不得不做的那样\]。

Moreover, as we know from studying the DV cycle, many narcissistic abusers know when and how to shower romantic tidbits on their victims just when they are at the point of leaving. These narcissists are often the charming bullies described in the last chapter. Their infrequent tidbits have more warmth in them than anything the codependent received at home, so she quickly becomes re-hooked, and just as quickly the cycle of abuse begins again.

此外，正如我们从研究家庭暴力周期中所知，许多自恋型施虐者知道何时以及如何在他们受害者即将离开时给予他们浪漫的小恩小惠。这些自恋者通常是上一章中描述的迷人的恶霸。他们的罕见的小恩小惠比共依存者在家里收到的任何东西都要温暖，因此她很快就会再次上钩，然后虐待的周期又开始。

It is important to note that many charming bullies also offer copious tidbits briefly in the courtship stage, but these peter out to near starvation rations once the entrapment is complete.

值得注意的是，许多迷人的恶霸也会在求爱阶段提供大量的小恩小惠，但一旦陷阱完成，这些恩惠就会减少到几乎饿死的地步。

Many fawn-freeze types only make token efforts at recovery, if they do not avoid it altogether. Often fawn-freezes were forced to so thoroughly abandon their protective instincts that they become trapped in what psychologists call _learned helplessness._

许多无鹿冻类型只在恢复上做些象征性的努力，如果他们不是完全避免的话。通常，无鹿冻被迫彻底放弃他们的保护本能，以至于他们陷入了心理学家所说的习得性无助。

Finally, there is growing evidence that a significant number of men also silently suffer domestic violence. A male client once told me that no matter how much his wife assaulted him, he couldn’t stop himself from saying “I’m sorry” to her. This only made her madder, but not as mad as when he flashbacked into saying: “I’m sorry for saying ‘I’m sorry’ “, even though his wife would slap him in the face every time he did.

最后，越来越多的证据表明，许多男性也在默默忍受家庭暴力。一位男性客户曾告诉我，无论他的妻子如何攻击他，他都无法阻止自己向她道歉。这只会让她更加愤怒，但还不像当他回想起说“我为说‘对不起’而道歉”时那么愤怒，尽管每次他这样做，他的妻子都会打他的脸。

Not surprisingly, further investigation revealed a borderline mother who still slaps him in the face when she is displeased with him. As a child he was required to keep his hands down whenever she slapped him. He then had to apologize for making her “have to” punish him. Unfortunately, he left therapy after only a few sessions because his wife looked in his checkbook, and then hit him repeatedly for “wasting his time and her money.”

不出所料，进一步调查发现了一位边缘母亲，当她对他不满时，仍然会打他的脸。作为孩子，每次她打他时，他都必须放下手。然后他必须道歉，因为他让她“不得不”惩罚他。不幸的是，他只在治疗了几次后就离开了，因为他的妻子查看了他的支票簿，然后反复打他，因为他“浪费了时间和她的钱。”

I have worked a great deal with these fawn-freeze types in my years of doing telephone crisis counseling. Hope for them lies in understanding how their childhood abuse set them up for their [[null|]]current abuse. This is often difficult, because scapegoated fawn-freezes were often punished extra intensely for complaining.

我在多年的电话危机咨询工作中与这些没有鹿角的人打交道很多。对他们来说，希望在于理解他们的童年虐待是如何为他们现在的虐待埋下伏笔的。这通常很困难，因为被当作替罪羊的没有鹿角的人往往因为抱怨而受到额外的严厉惩罚。

Numerous times I have heard DV victims say: “But, I don’t want to act like a victim!” Usually, I then try to help them see how much they truly were victims in childhood. However, if I cannot get them to see this they usually are not able to rescue themselves from their current victimization.

无数次，我听到 DV 受害者说：“但是，我不想表现得像个受害者！”通常，我会尝试帮助他们看到他们在童年时期确实是个受害者。然而，如果我不能让他们看到这一点，他们通常无法从当前的受害者状态中自救。
