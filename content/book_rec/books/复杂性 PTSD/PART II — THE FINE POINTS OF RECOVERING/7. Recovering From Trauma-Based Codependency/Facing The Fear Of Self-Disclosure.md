\*\*Facing The Fear Of Self-Disclosure

面对自我披露的恐惧\*\*

Real motivation for surmounting this challenge usually comes from family of origin work. We need to intuit and puzzle together a detailed picture of the trauma that first frightened us out of our instincts of healthy self-expression.

克服这一挑战的真实动力通常来自原生家庭工作。我们需要直觉和拼凑出一幅详细的画面，描绘出最初让我们从健康自我表达的本能中惊恐出来的创伤。

When we emotionally remember how overpowered we were as children, we can begin to realize that it was because we were too small and powerless to assert ourselves. But now in our adult bodies, we are in a much more powerful situation.

当我们从情感上回忆起我们作为孩子是多么的无助时，我们可以开始意识到，那是因为我们太小、太无力去维护自己的权益。但现在，在我们的成年身体里，我们处于一个更强大的境地。

And even though we might still momentarily feel small and helpless when we are triggered, we can learn to remind ourselves that we are now in an adult body. We have an adult status that now offers us many more resources to champion ourselves and to effectively protest unfairness in relationships.

即使在我们被触发时仍然可能暂时感到渺小和无助，我们也可以学会提醒自己，我们现在拥有成年人的身体。我们拥有成年人的地位，这为我们提供了更多的资源，让我们能够为自己辩护，并在关系中有效地抗议不公平。
