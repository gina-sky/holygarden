**A DEFINITON OF TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY  
  
创伤性依赖性人格障碍的定义**

More than a few of my clients were initially put off by the term codependent. They found it confusing or irrelevant because the descriptions they read or heard were presented derogatorily. Moreover, some felt that the descriptions did not pertain to their condition. If that is true for you, the section below on codependent subtypes explains how the fawn response can manifest in a variety of different behaviors.  
  
不少客户最初对“共生依赖”这个词感到反感。他们认为这个词令人困惑或不相关，因为他们阅读或听到的描述都是贬义的。此外，有些人觉得这些描述并不适用于他们的状况。如果这也适用于你，下面关于共生依赖亚型的部分将解释鹿反应如何在各种不同的行为中表现出来。

I define trauma-induced codependency as a syndrome of self-abandonment and self-abnegation. Codependency is a fear-based inability to express rights, needs and boundaries in relationship. It is a disorder of assertiveness, characterized by a dormant fight response and a susceptibility to being exploited, abused and/or neglected.  
  
我将创伤引起的共生依赖定义为自我放弃和自我否定的综合症。共生依赖是一种基于恐惧的无法在关系中表达权利、需求和界限的能力。它是一种自信心的障碍，表现为潜伏的战斗反应和对被剥削、虐待和/或忽视的易感性。

In conversations, codependents seek safety and acceptance in relationship through listening and eliciting. They invite the other to talk rather than risk exposing their thoughts, views, and feelings. They ask questions to keep the attention off themselves, because their parents taught them that talking was dangerous and that their words were indictments that would inevitably prove them guilty of being unworthy.  
  
在对话中，共生依赖者通过倾听和引导来寻求关系中的安全和接受。他们邀请对方说话，而不是冒险暴露自己的思想、观点和感受。他们提问以将注意力从自己身上转移开，因为他们的父母教导他们说话是危险的，他们的言语是控诉，必然会证明他们有罪，不值得。

The implicit code of the fawn type is that it is safer \[1\] to listen than to talk, \[2\] to agree than to dissent, \[3\] to offer care than to ask for help, \[4\] to elicit the other than to express yourself and \[5\] to leave choices to the other rather than to express preferences. Sadly, the closest that the unrecovered fawn type comes to getting his needs met is vicariously through helping others. Fawn types generally enhance their recovery by memorizing the list of Human Rights in [[Toolbox 2. Human Bill of Rights|Toolbox 2]], [[16. Self-Help Tools|chapter 16]].  
  
幼鹿型隐含的代码是：比起说话，倾听更安全\[1\]；比起反对，同意更安全\[2\]；比起寻求帮助，给予关怀更安全\[3\]；比起表达自己，激发他人更安全\[4\]；比起表达偏好，留给他人选择更安全\[5\]。遗憾的是，未恢复的幼鹿型最接近满足自己需求的方式是通过帮助他人。幼鹿型通常通过记忆《工具箱 2》第 16 章中的人权清单来增强他们的恢复。

[[null|]]I have this sardonic fantasy about two codependents going on their first date. Somehow they have agreed that they want to go to a movie, but how will they ever choose which one? “What do you want to see?” “Oh, I’m easy what do you want to see?” “It really doesn’t matter to me, I like everything.” ‘Me too why don’t you choose?” “Oh I think it would be much better if you pick.” “Oh I couldn’t, I never pick the right one.” “Me too, but I’m sure my pick would definitely be the worst.” And so it goes, ad infinitum, until it is too late to see any show, and relieved at not having to put themselves out there, they call it a night.  
  
我有一个讽刺的幻想，关于两个相互依赖的人第一次约会。他们 somehow 约好去看电影，但如何选择哪一部呢？“你想要看什么？” “哦，我无所谓，你想要看什么？” “这对我来说真的不重要，我喜欢所有的一切。” ‘我也是，为什么不让你来选呢？’ “哦，我觉得如果你来选会更好。” “哦，我做不到，我从来选不对。” “我也是，但我肯定我的选择绝对是最好的。” 就这样，一直持续下去，直到看任何一场演出的时间都太晚了，他们感到如释重负，不用把自己放在外面，于是他们结束了这一晚。
