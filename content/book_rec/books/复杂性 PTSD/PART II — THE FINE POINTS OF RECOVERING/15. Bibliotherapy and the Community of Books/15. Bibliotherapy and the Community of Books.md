BIBLIOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY OF BOOKS  
  
图书疗法与书籍社区

Bibliotherapy is a term that describes the very real process of being positively and therapeutically influenced by what you read. As stated earlier, when it is at its most powerful, bibliotherapy is also relationally healing. It can rescue you from the common Cptsd feeling of abject isolation and alienation.  
  
图书疗法是一个描述通过阅读对你产生积极和治疗效果的过程的术语。如前所述，当它最强大时，图书疗法也是一种关系上的疗愈。它可以帮助你摆脱常见的 Cptsd 感觉，即彻底的孤独和疏离。

Bibliotherapy can play an enormous role in enhancing recovery from Cptsd. I usually find that my clients who make the most progress are those who augment their therapy sessions with reading homework \[self-prescribed or recommended by me\].  
  
图书疗法在增强 Cptsd 恢复方面可以发挥巨大的作用。我通常发现，那些在治疗过程中增加阅读作业（自我推荐的或由我推荐的）的客户进步最大。

This is especially true of those who further augment their reading with journaling about their cognitive and emotional responses to what they have read. I believe that journaling helps build the new physiological and neuronal brain circuitry that occurs as we effectively meet our developmentally arrested childhood needs. \[For [[null|]]more on Journaltherapy, read the section on verbal ventilating in [[5. What if I Was Never Hit_|chapter 5]] of my first book\].  
  
这对于那些进一步通过记录他们对所读内容的认知和情感反应来增强阅读的人来说尤其如此。我相信，记录有助于构建我们在有效满足我们发展停滞的童年需求时发生的新生理和神经元大脑回路。\[关于 Journaltherapy 的更多信息，请参阅我第一本书第五章中的言语排解部分\]。

Bibliotherapy is especially helpful for people like me who grew up in dangerous social environments replete with adults who offered little but criticism, intimidation and disgust. It equally serves those whose early lives were devoid of adults who could be looked to for safe support and guidance.  
  
文献疗法对于像我这样在充满批评、恐吓和厌恶的成人环境中长大的人来说特别有帮助。它同样服务于那些早年生活中缺乏可以寻求安全支持和指导的成人的人。

It was not until later in life, after I had quite a few years of group and individual therapy, that I realized that my journey of recovering had actually begun decades before my formal therapy. It began with all the therapeutic reading and writing I had instinctively gravitated to. I unconsciously sought the help of others in the many spiritual and psychological self-help books that I was intuitively drawn to.  
  
直到我成年后，经过多年的团体和个体治疗，我才意识到我的康复之旅实际上是在正式治疗之前几十年就开始了。它始于我本能地倾向于的所有治疗性阅读和写作。我无意识地从许多我直觉上被吸引的精神和心理自助书籍中寻求他人的帮助。

Without really understanding it, I gained valuable insights about how to improve the way I treated myself and others. Just as importantly, I subliminally realized that there were a number of good, safe, wise and helpful adults out there who could be trusted and who had a great deal of wise and kind guidance to offer.  
  
虽然没有真正理解这一点，但我获得了关于如何改善自己对待自己和他人方式的有价值见解。同样重要的是，我潜意识地意识到，世界上有许多善良、安全、明智和乐于助人的成人，他们值得信赖，并且能够提供大量明智和仁慈的指导。

I remember my first deeply emotional experience of entering _the community of books._ I was in the library resentfully slogging through the poetry section trying to find a book for my homework in high school English.  
  
我记得我第一次进入书籍社区的深刻情感体验。我在图书馆里，带着不满的情绪，艰难地在诗歌区寻找高中英语作业的书。

I was up to “W “and had found nothing that remotely interested me when I came to an anthology with the picture of a very compelling looking old man on its cover. Walt Whitman! His epic poems _Song of Myself_ and _Song of the Open Road_ thrilled me and changed my life. He became my hero and the first adult role model that had something useful and important to teach me. His ideas became my _raison d’être_ and gave me a hopeful plan for what I would do when I finally escaped my family.  
  
我翻到了“W”，却一无所获，直到我发现了一本封面上有位非常吸引人的老者照片的选集。沃尔特·惠特曼！他的史诗诗篇《自我之歌》和《开放之路之歌》让我激动不已，改变了我的生活。他成为了我的英雄，第一个对我有所教益和重要影响的大人。他的思想成为了我的存在理由，并给了我一个当我最终逃离家庭时将如何行动的希望计划。

[[null|]]Over time the authors in my community of books seemed like a small tribe of elders who I imagined as people who would have empathy for me if I were to meet them. Eventually when I achieved something of a critical mass of this awareness, I managed to take a frightening leap into the water of therapy. I lucked out and got a good enough therapist to help me take steps in my healing that I could not manage on my own.  
  
随着时间的推移，我书中的作者们似乎成了一小群长者，我想象着如果遇到他们，他们会对我有同情心。最终，当我达到这种意识的一个临界点时，我设法勇敢地跳进了治疗的水中。我运气不错，找到了一个足够好的治疗师，帮助我在自我疗愈的道路上迈出了我独自无法做到的步伐。

So here are some authors \[and their works\] who have been especially helpful to me on my journey. These are the wise aunts and uncles I never biologically had.  
  
所以，以下是一些在我人生旅程中特别有帮助的作者\[以及他们的作品\]。这些是我从未在生物学上拥有的明智的叔叔阿姨。
