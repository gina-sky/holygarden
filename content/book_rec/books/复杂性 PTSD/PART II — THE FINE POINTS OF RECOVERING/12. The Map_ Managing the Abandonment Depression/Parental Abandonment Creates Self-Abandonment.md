**Parental Abandonment Creates Self-Abandonment  
  
父母遗弃导致自我遗弃**

Once again, we had to dissociate with these layered defenses because we were not developmentally capable of managing the pain of being abandoned. We could not tolerate feeling the fear, shame and inconsolableness of it. We could not use our anger and tears to release this shame and fear. We could not bear to stay tuned in to the incessantly persecutory critic, over which we were powerless. We could only fight, flee, freeze or fawn. Over time this elaborate cycle of self-abandonment became habitual.  
  
又一次，我们不得不与这些层层的防御机制分离，因为我们还没有发展到能够处理被遗弃的痛苦。我们无法忍受感受到恐惧、羞耻和无法安慰。我们无法利用我们的愤怒和眼泪来释放这种羞耻和恐惧。我们无法忍受持续关注那不断迫害的批评者，我们对它无能为力。我们只能战斗、逃跑、冻结或谄媚。随着时间的推移，这种复杂的自我遗弃周期变得习惯化。

Chronic emotional abandonment devastates a child. It naturally makes her feel and appear deadened and depressed. Functional parents respond to a child’s depression with concern and comfort. Abandoning parents respond to the child with anger, disgust and/[[null|]]or further abandonment, which in turn exacerbate the fear, shame and despair that become the abandonment mélange.  
  
长期情感遗弃对孩子的打击是毁灭性的。这自然会让她感到和看起来麻木和抑郁。功能性的父母会对孩子的抑郁表示关心和安慰。遗弃型的父母则会以愤怒、厌恶和/或进一步的遗弃来回应孩子，这反而加剧了恐惧、羞愧和绝望，这些成为了遗弃的混合体。
