\*\*Hunger As Camouflaged Depression

饥饿伪装成抑郁\*\*

Feelings of abandonment commonly masquerade as the physiological sensations of hunger. Hunger pain soon after a big meal is rarely truly about food. Typically it is camouflaged emotional hunger and the longing for safe, nurturing connection. Food cannot satiate the hunger pain of abandonment. Only loving support can. Geneen Roth’s book offers powerful self-help book on this subject.

被遗弃的感觉通常伪装成饥饿的生理感觉。大餐后不久的饥饿疼痛很少真正是因为食物。通常，它是一种隐藏的情感饥饿和对安全、滋养的连接的渴望。食物无法满足被遗弃的饥饿痛苦。只有爱的支持才能。Geneen Roth 的书籍提供了关于这个主题的有力自助书籍。

[[null|]]Even after a decade of practice, I still find it difficult to differentiate this type of attachment hunger from physical hunger. One often reliable clue is that the sensation of longing for the nourishment of attachment is usually in my small intestine, while physical hunger’s locus is a little higher up in my stomach. When I can take the time to meditate on this lower abdomen sensation, I often become aware that I am in a low level flashback. Feeling through this uncomfortable sensation typically resolves both the flashback and my false hunger.

即使练习了十年，我仍然发现很难区分这种依恋饥饿和生理饥饿。一个经常可靠的线索是，渴望依恋滋养的感觉通常在我的小肠中，而生理饥饿的焦点则稍微高一点，在我的胃里。当我有时间冥想这种下腹部感觉时，我经常意识到自己处于低水平的闪回中。通过这种不舒服的感觉感受通常可以解决闪回和我的虚假饥饿。

I believe this type of emotional hunger is at the core of most food addictions. One of the reasons food addictions are so difficult to manage is that food was the first source of self-comforting that was available to us. With the dearth of any other comfort, there is little wonder that we came to over-rely on eating for nurturance.

我相信这种情感饥饿是大多数食物成瘾的核心。食物成瘾之所以难以管理，其中一个原因就是食物是我们最初可以用来自我安慰的来源。由于缺乏其他安慰，我们过度依赖食物来滋养自己也就不足为奇了。

In fact, like Gabor Mate, I believe that attachment hunger is at the core of most addictive behavior, even process addictions. An example of the latter is the sex and love addict’s desperate pursuit of high intensity relating. Perhaps all addictive behavior is our misguided attempts to self-medicate deeper abandonment pain and unmet attachment needs.

事实上，就像加博尔·马泰一样，我相信依恋渴望是大多数成瘾行为的核心，甚至是过程成瘾。后者的一个例子是性爱和爱情成瘾者对高强度的关系的绝望追求。也许所有成瘾行为都是我们错误地试图自我治疗更深的遗弃痛苦和未满足的依恋需求。
