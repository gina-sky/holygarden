**Dissolving Depression By Fully Feeling It  
  
通过完全感受它来消解抑郁**

Gradually, my focused awareness began to metabolize my fear. Many months later, I was typically able to relax the tense fearful sensations of a flashback within ten minutes. As I became more successful at digesting my fear, I experientially discovered the rock bottom underlying core sensations of my abandonment depression itself.  
  
渐渐地，我的专注意识开始消化我的恐惧。许多个月后，我通常能在十分钟内放松紧张恐惧的闪回感。当我越来越擅长消化我的恐惧时，我体验到了我放弃抑郁本身所隐藏的底层核心感觉。

Mindful merging with the subtle emotions and sensations of depression is the finishing tool of deconstructing self-abandonment. Over and over I focused on the sensations of my depression. Occasionally these sensations were intense, but more often they were very subtle. Often it was difficult to resist the urge to fall asleep, and many times I could not.  
  
与抑郁的微妙情绪和感觉进行正念融合是解构自我放弃的完成工具。我一次又一次地专注于我抑郁的感觉。偶尔这些感觉很强烈，但更常见的是非常微妙。我经常难以抵抗入睡的冲动，很多时候我做不到。

At other times, I noticed how instantly my depression scared me back into fear. Simultaneously the sensations of depression also triggered me into toxic shame. Often, I would witness myself echoing my parents’ contempt: “…bad, lazy, worthless, good-for-nothing, stick-in-the-mud, etc.”  
  
有时，我注意到我的抑郁是如何立刻让我感到恐惧。同时，抑郁的感觉也激发了我对有毒的羞愧。常常，我会看到自己在重复父母的蔑视：“……坏，懒惰，毫无价值，废物，顽固不化，等等。”

Blessedly, with ongoing practice, I gradually learned to dis-identify from the toxic vocabulary of the critic. I also learned to [[null|]]stay awake most of the time. I then found myself more accurately naming these revisited childhood feelings: “Small, helpless, lonely, unsupported, unloved.” Over time, this in turn rewarded me with a profound sense of compassion for the abandoned child I was.  
  
幸亏，随着持续的练习，我逐渐学会了不再认同批评者的有毒词汇。我也学会了大多数时候保持清醒。然后我发现，我能够更准确地命名这些重新审视的童年感受：“渺小、无助、孤独、无人支持、不被爱。”随着时间的推移，这反过来赋予了我对曾经那个被遗弃的孩子的深刻同情。

Moreover, I made the wonderful discovery that sensate focusing, when it has been well practiced and developed, is the ultimate thought-stopping technique. When the critic is especially loud and persistent, shifting your awareness from thinking to feeling your sensations is a potent way of coming home to a safer place. It is, as one survivor told me, “coming home to rest in the mother of your body.”  
  
此外，我发现了一个美妙的事实，那就是当感觉集中练习得很好并得到发展时，它是终极的停止思考的技术。当批评者特别大声且坚持不懈时，将你的意识从思考转移到感受你的感觉是一种回到更安全的地方的有效方式。正如一位幸存者告诉我的那样，“回到你的身体之母那里休息。”

In my current recovery work, I most commonly apply this mindfulness technique to experiences of survival-mode depression. For me this low grade manifestation of the abandonment depression typically gets triggered by a few nights of poor sleep, which often decreases my energy level and dulls my ability to concentrate. Most of my life, this feeling experience provided rich fodder for my critic. Over the years however, increased mindfulness allows me to see that I typically function well enough no matter how tired or introverted I feel. These days, I am sometimes even able to authentically welcome the most exhausted of these experiences as a chance to take a break from my less essential routines. I have learned how to resist my critic’s all-or-none _productivity program,_ and be satisfied with days of getting less done.  
  
在我目前的康复工作中，我通常将这种正念技巧应用于生存模式抑郁的经历。对我来说，这种被遗弃抑郁的低级表现通常是由几晚的睡眠质量差触发的，这往往降低了我的能量水平，并削弱了我集中注意力的能力。在我的一生中，这种感受为我的批评家提供了丰富的素材。然而，随着正念的增强，我逐渐意识到，无论我感到多么疲惫或内向，我通常都能很好地工作。如今，我有时甚至能够真诚地欢迎这些最疲惫的经历，将其视为从不那么重要的日常例行程序中休息的机会。我已经学会了如何抵制批评家全有或全无的生产力计划，并对完成较少的工作感到满意。
