\*\*Separating Necessary Suffering From Unnecessary Suffering

区分必要的苦难和不必要的苦难\*\*

You can sometimes gain motivation for this difficult work by seeing your depressed feelings as messages from your inner child who is feeling as abandoned as he ever was. Perhaps this time you can come to him with your remothering-self in a more comforting and protective way. Through such practice, you can gradually achieve the healing that Buddhists call separating necessary suffering \[normal fear and depression\] from unnecessary suffering \[unconscious self-abandonment to helplessness, toxic shame, Cptsd fear, retraumatizing inner critic _acting in_, and 4F _acting out_\].

您有时可以通过将您的抑郁情绪视为来自内心深处、感到被遗弃的孩子发出的信息来为这项艰难的工作获得动力。也许这次，您可以用一个更加温暖和保护的自我抚育方式向他靠近。通过这样的练习，您可以逐渐实现佛教所说的将必要的痛苦\[正常的恐惧和抑郁\]与不必要的痛苦\[无意识的自我放弃、有害的羞愧、Cptsd 恐惧、内在批评者的重创行为和 4F 的过度行为\]分开的治疗。
