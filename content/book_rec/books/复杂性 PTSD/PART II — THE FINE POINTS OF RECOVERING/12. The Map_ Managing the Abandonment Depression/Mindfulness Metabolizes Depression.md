正念化解抑郁**

Deep level recovery from childhood trauma requires a normalization of depression, a renunciation of the habit of reflexively reacting to it.

Once again, mindfulness is the practice of staying in your body – the practice of staying fully present to all of your internal experience.

Steven Levine’s beautiful book, _Who Dies,_ is an enlightening, jargon-less and easily accessible guide book on learning the practice of mindfulness.
