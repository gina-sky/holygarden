\*\*Deconstructing Self-Abandonment

分解自我遗弃\*\*

Because of our parents’ rejection, the mildest hint of depression, no matter how functional or appropriate, can instantly flash us back into our original abandonment depression. The capacity to self-nurturingly weather any experience of depression, no matter how mild, remains unrealized. Our original experience of parental abandonment has morphed into habitual self-abandonment.

由于我们父母的拒绝，即使是轻微的抑郁暗示，无论多么功能性强或合适，都会瞬间把我们带回到最初的遗弃抑郁中。无论抑郁多么轻微，自我滋养地应对任何抑郁体验的能力仍然没有实现。我们最初的父母遗弃体验已经转变为习惯性的自我遗弃。

We can gradually deconstruct the self-abandoning habit of reacting to depression with fear and shame, inner critic catastrophizing, and 4F acting out. The mindfulness processes described below awaken the psyche’s innate capacity to respond with compassion to depression. Mindfulness also helps us metabolize the fear and shame that we were forced to feel about being depressed.

我们可以逐渐分解用恐惧和羞愧来应对抑郁、内心批评灾难化和 4F 行为表现出的自我遗弃习惯。下面描述的正念过程唤醒了心理内在的以同情心回应抑郁的能力。正念还有助于我们消化被迫感受到的关于抑郁的恐惧和羞愧。

Ending our reactivity to depression is typically a long difficult journey. This is because our culture routinely humiliates us for any expression of depression. It pathologizes us as if we are violating our patriotic duty to be fully engaged in “the pursuit of happiness.”

结束对抑郁的反应通常是一场漫长而艰难的旅程。这是因为我们的文化常常因为任何抑郁的表达而羞辱我们。它将我们病理化，仿佛我们违反了我们的爱国义务，即全身心投入“追求幸福”。

Taboos about depression even emanate from the psychological establishment, where some schools strip it of its status as a legitimate feeling. For them, depression is nothing more than a waste product of negative thinking. Other schools reduce it simplistically to a dysfunctional state that results from the repression of somewhat less taboo emotions like sadness and anger. This is not to say that these factors cannot cause depression. It is to say that depression is a legitimate feeling that often contains the helpful and important information described below.

关于抑郁的禁忌甚至源自心理界，其中一些学派剥夺了抑郁作为合法情感的资格。对他们来说，抑郁不过是消极思考的副产品。其他学派则简单地将它归结为一种功能失调的状态，这种状态源于对某些不那么禁忌的情感，如悲伤和愤怒的压抑。这并不是说这些因素不能导致抑郁。这是说，抑郁是一种合法的情感，它往往包含以下描述的有用和重要的信息。
