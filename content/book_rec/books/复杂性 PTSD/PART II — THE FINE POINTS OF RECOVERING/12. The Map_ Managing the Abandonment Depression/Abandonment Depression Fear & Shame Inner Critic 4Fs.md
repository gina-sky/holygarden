Let us look at a case example of how triggering works in the reverse direction. My mega-perfectionistic, flight-type client, Mario, came into our session five minutes late. It was the first time he had been late in two years of therapy.  
  
让我们来看一个案例，看看触发是如何在相反方向起作用的。我的极度完美主义、逃避型客户马里奥迟到了五分钟。这是他在两年治疗中第一次迟到。

Mario was in full-fledged flight, sweating from racing up the hill from his parking space a block away. He told me he just could not sit on the couch today. Could he please just pace in front of the couch. “I hate being late. I won’t tell you - please don’t ask – just how fast I was driving on the freeway!”  
  
马里奥正在全力飞行，从离他停车位一个街区远的山上跑下来，汗水淋漓。他告诉我，他今天就是不能坐在沙发上。他能否就在沙发前踱步。“我讨厌迟到。我不会告诉你——请不要问——我在高速公路上开得多快！”

Mario compulsively paced, but this driven-ness was nothing compared to the speed of his obsessing, as he rattled off many versions of most of the inner critic attack programs listed in [[9. Shrinking the Inner Critic|chapter 9]].  
  
马里奥强迫性地踱步，但与他的痴迷速度相比，这种驱动力微不足道，因为他一口气列举了第 9 章中列出的大多数内心批评攻击程序的多个版本。

To him, his being late was merely the tip of the iceberg of his defectiveness. As his rant against himself amped up, he increasingly scared himself with his own words, and shamed himself with his parents’ disgust.  
  
对他来说，他迟到只是他缺陷的冰山一角。随着他对自己的抱怨升级，他越来越被自己的话吓到，并用父母的厌恶来羞辱自己。

[[null|]]Finally, seemingly exhausted, Mario collapsed on the couch, and launched into the first suicidal ideation I had ever heard from him. He had just landed in the pit of the abandonment mélange \[depression encrusted with fear and shame\] and was sinking to the bottom into a despairing depression of helplessness and hopelessness. This was the real helplessness and hopelessness that had so characterized his childhood.  
  
最后，看起来筋疲力尽，马里奥倒在沙发上，开始向我倾诉他从未向我透露过的第一次自杀念头。他刚刚陷入被遗弃的混合体\[抑郁附着着恐惧和羞愧\]的深渊，正在绝望地沉入无助和绝望的抑郁之中。这正是他童年时期所特有的真正无助和绝望。

Fortunately, I had been diligently planting seeds about his need to grieve over the last two years. For the first time since early childhood, the tears came, and it was the most moving monsoon I had witnessed in ages. He cried for the little forsaken boy he had been. He came home, via his pain, to being on his side. The long exile into self-abandonment was temporarily over for the first time that he could remember.  
  
幸运的是，我在过去两年里一直勤奋地播种关于他需要哀悼的想法。自从童年早期以来，他第一次流泪，这是我多年来见过的最感人的季风。他为曾经那个被遗弃的小男孩而哭泣。他通过痛苦回到了自己的身边。他第一次记得，那漫长的自我放弃的流放暂时结束了。

We were then able to look at the cycle of reactivity that had turned into a cyclone. Triggered by a traffic jam into the “terrible danger” of being late, Cptsd launched him into his flight response as he raced to get to my office. The flight response also immediately triggered the inner critic to attack him for his lateness and to catastrophize about the consequences. As it did he fell deeper and deeper into shame and fear, and then ultimately into the abandonment depression itself.  
  
然后，我们能够审视那个已经变成飓风的反应周期。由交通堵塞引发的“可怕危险”的迟到，让他在冲向我的办公室时启动了战斗或逃跑反应。战斗或逃跑反应也立即触发了内心的批评家攻击他迟到，并对他可能面临的后果进行灾难化思考。随着这种情况的发生，他越来越深地陷入羞愧和恐惧，最终陷入了被遗弃的抑郁。

This time however, Mario broke the flashback with his tears, as his crying released his fear and shame. This in turn defueled his critic and allowed his body to begin releasing the hyperarousal of his flight response.  
  
然而这一次，马里奥通过泪水打破了闪回，因为他的哭泣释放了他的恐惧和羞愧。这反过来又削弱了他的批评家，并让他的身体开始释放战斗或逃跑反应的过度警觉。

Had he not been able to do this, he most likely would have continued attacking himself with shame-fueled perfectionism and fear-fueled drasticizing. He would then have launched out of the session back to obsessively and compulsively racing through his day driven by his infinite to-do list.  
  
如果他做不到这一点，他很可能继续用羞愧驱动的完美主义和恐惧驱动的极端主义来攻击自己。然后他会从会话中冲出去，回到他那无限的任务清单，强迫性地、强迫性地度过每一天。
