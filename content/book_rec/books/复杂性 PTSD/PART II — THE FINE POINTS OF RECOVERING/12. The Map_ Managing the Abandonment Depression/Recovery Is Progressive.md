**Recovery Is Progressive  
  
恢复是渐进的**

I begin this section by repeating the [[4. The Progression of Recovering|chapter 4]] section: “Stages of Recovery.” This section outlines the overall course of recovery. Hopefully you will notice, since you began reading this book, that your understanding of Cptsd has been significantly enhanced. I also hope that you sense a greater sense of self-compassion and direction in your recovery process.  
  
我以重复第四章的“恢复阶段”这一部分开始本节。本节概述了恢复的整体过程。希望您能注意到，自从您开始阅读这本书以来，您对 Cptsd 的理解已经显著提高。我也希望您在恢复过程中能感受到更多的自我同情和方向感。

“Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some degree progressive. It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps us understand that we have Cptsd. This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.  
  
“尽管我们经常同时在不同层面上进行恢复工作，但恢复在一定程度上是逐步进行的。它始于认知层面，当心理教育和正念帮助我们理解自己患有创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）时，这种觉醒使我们能够学习如何接近解构 Cptsd 各种破坏生活的动态的旅程。

Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic. Some survivors will need to do a great [[null|]]deal of work on this level before they can move down to the emotional layer of work, which is learning how to grieve effectively.  
  
仍然在认知层面，我们接下来要做的长篇工作是缩小批评的声音。一些幸存者需要在这个层面上做大量的工作，才能向下移动到情感层面，也就是学习如何有效地哀悼。

The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of recovery work. This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world. At this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem.  
  
童年失去的悲痛阶段可能持续几年。在悲痛方面取得足够进步后，幸存者自然会进入下一阶段的恢复工作。这涉及到通过悲痛我们失去的世界安全感来克服恐惧。在这个阶段，我们也学会通过悲痛我们自尊心的丧失来克服我们的有毒羞愧。

As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address the core issue of our Cptsd – the abandonment depression itself. The final task here involves releasing the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression via the somatic work discussed in this chapter. This work culminates with learning to compassionately support ourselves through our experiences of depression.  
  
随着我们在这种深层水平的哀悼中变得更加熟练，我们就准备好解决我们 Cptsd 的核心问题——被遗弃的抑郁本身。这里的最终任务是通过本章讨论的身体工作，释放我们身体对被遗弃的抑郁的盔甲和生理反应。这项工作最终 culminates with learning to compassionately support ourselves through our experiences of depression.

Finally, as we will see in the [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|next chapter]], many survivors need some relational help in achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-exacerbating defenses.”  
  
最后，正如我们在下一章中将要看到的，许多幸存者在分解我们旧的加剧痛苦的防御机制所涉及的复杂任务时，需要一些关系上的帮助。”
