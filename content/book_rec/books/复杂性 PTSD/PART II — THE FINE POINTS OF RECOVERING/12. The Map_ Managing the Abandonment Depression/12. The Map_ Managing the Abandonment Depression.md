THE MAP: MANAGING THE ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION

地图：管理被遗弃的抑郁

Cptsd burdens us with a hair-trigger susceptibility to painful emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks, as we have seen, are layers of defensive reactions to the abandonment depression. These reactions include physical, behavioral, cognitive, emotional and relational responses to the reemerging sense of danger and despair that plagued our childhood abandonment.

PTSD 让我们承受着对痛苦情绪闪回的易感性。正如我们所见，闪回是对被遗弃抑郁的防御性反应的层次。这些反应包括对重新出现的危险和绝望感的身体、行为、认知、情感和关系上的反应，这些感受困扰了我们的童年被遗弃的经历。

This chapter presents a map of these layered, defensive reactions to abandonment pain. This map shows you which reactions are most important to work on at any given time. It includes a strategy for reducing harmful reactions that are no longer necessary. This strategy involves self-compassionately soothing yourself when you are trapped in fear and/or depression, so that you do not launch into intensified fear, toxic shame, critic attacks, or self-damaging 4F reactions.

本章呈现了这些层次化的防御性反应的地图。这张地图显示了在任何给定时间应该关注哪些反应。它包括减少不再必要的有害反应的策略。这个策略涉及在恐惧和/或抑郁中自我安慰，以便你不会陷入加剧的恐惧、有毒的羞愧、批评攻击或自我破坏的 4F 反应。
