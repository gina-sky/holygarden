**The Layers Of Dissociation In The Cycle Of Reactivity  
  
反应循环中的解离层**

All the layered reactions in the cycle of reactivity are defenses against the abandonment depression. Each layer is also a defense [[null|]]against all of the other layers beneath it. As such, each layer is a type of dissociation. When we are triggered and lost in a 4F response, we fight, flee, freeze or fawn to _dis_associate ourselves from the painful voice of the critic. On a deeper layer, the critic is also distracting and disassociating us from our emotional pain. Moreover, fear and shame dis-associate us from the bottom layer - the terrible abandonment depression itself. Dissociation \[the psychological term for disassociation\], then, is the process of rendering all these levels less conscious or totally unconscious.  
  
反应循环中的所有分层反应都是对遗弃抑郁症的防御。每一层也是对它下面的所有其他层的防御。因此，每一层都是一种解离。当我们被触发并陷入 4F 反应时，我们通过战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好来解离自己，以摆脱批评者的痛苦声音。在更深的一层，批评者也在分散我们的注意力，并让我们从情感痛苦中解离出来。此外，恐惧和羞愧让我们从底层——可怕的遗弃抑郁症本身——中解离出来。因此，解离（心理学术语，指解离）就是使所有这些层次变得不那么有意识或完全无意识的过程。

As recovery progresses and we learn to stay present enough to the critic to begin shrinking it, we become increasingly aware of the fear and shame that underlies it. With sufficient feeling into fear and shame, we notice that fear and shame cover up the deadened feelings of the abandonment depression itself. Learning to stay self-supportingly present to the feelings of this depression is the deepest level, bottom-of-the-barrel work of recovery. When we are able to do this, our recovering has reached a profound level.  
  
随着恢复的进展，我们学会足够地专注于批评，开始缩小它，我们越来越意识到它背后隐藏的恐惧和羞耻。在足够的情感投入中，我们注意到恐惧和羞耻掩盖了被遗弃抑郁症本身的麻木感。学会自我支持地专注于这种抑郁的感觉是恢复的最深层次，是底层的工作。当我们能够做到这一点时，我们的恢复已经达到了一个深刻的水平。
