**Introspective Somatic Work  
  
内省性身体工作**

I began my journey of learning how to feel by devoting a half hour daily to feeling the sensations of my fear.  
  
我开始学习如何感受的旅程，每天花半小时感受我恐惧的感觉。

This was extremely difficult because I had survived my childhood with ADHD-like busyness. I had run daily marathons of activity to keep myself one step ahead of my fear and my shame-saturated depression. As an adult, I reduced this to half-marathons but I was still a busyholic, despite my relaxed persona. Tuning into how wired I was, was daunting. In my attempts to become more mindful, I was often exasperated by how frequently my awareness fled my body and went back into thinking or daydreaming.  
  
这极其困难，因为我用类似 ADHD 的忙碌度过了我的童年。我每天都要进行马拉松式的活动，以保持自己领先恐惧和充满羞耻感的抑郁一步。作为成年人，我把这减少到了半马拉松，但我仍然是个忙碌狂，尽管我的外表看起来很放松。意识到自己有多忙碌令人畏惧。在我试图更加有意识地生活时，我常常因为我的意识如何频繁地离开我的身体，回到思考和幻想中而感到沮丧。

[[null|]]In the first few months, my focus wavered wildly between feeling the tense sensations of my fear and being disrupted by inner critic thinking. I was assailed by a plethora of catastrophizing thoughts and visualizations. My critic repeatedly misinterpreted my fear as if I were still entrapped in my hazardous family.  
  
在最初的几个月里，我的注意力在感受到恐惧的紧张感与被内心批评者的思考打断之间摇摆不定。我被一系列灾难化的思想和想象所困扰。我的批评者反复误解我的恐惧，仿佛我仍然被困在我危险的家庭中。

My critic goaded me incessantly to launch into flight-mode. I was so itching to get going that I had strange tantalizing fantasies of cleaning my apartment, normally one of my least favorite things to do. In the first year of this practice, I frequently had to white-knuckle the handles on my chair to stay somatically present to my feelings. Otherwise, I would have been off and running into self-medicating with excessive adrenalization.  
  
我的批评家不停地催促我进入飞行模式。我急切地想要出发，以至于产生了奇怪的诱惑幻想，想要打扫我的公寓，这通常是我最不喜欢做的事情之一。在这项实践的第一年，我经常不得不紧紧抓住椅子的把手，以保持身体上的清醒，否则我就会开始自我医疗，过度肾上腺素化。
