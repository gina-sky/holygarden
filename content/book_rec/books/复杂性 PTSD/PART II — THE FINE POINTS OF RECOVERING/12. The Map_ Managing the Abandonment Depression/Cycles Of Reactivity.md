**Cycles Of Reactivity  
  
反应周期**

This section presents a verbal diagram of the layering of our reactions in an emotional flashback. Experiences of depression and abandonment trigger us into fear and shame, which then activates panicky inner critic thinking, which in turn launches us into an adrenalized fight, flight, freeze or fawn trauma response.  
  
本节展示了我们在情感回忆中反应层叠的口头图解。抑郁和被遗弃的经历让我们陷入恐惧和羞愧，这又激活了恐慌的内疚批评思维，进而引发我们进入肾上腺素激增的战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好创伤反应。

This is how that reactivity takes place in a flashback. A survivor wakes up feeling depressed. Because childhood experience has conditioned her to believe that she is unworthy and unacceptable in this state, she feels anxious and ashamed. This in turn activates her inner critic to scare her with perfectionistic rants: “No wonder no one likes me. I’ve got to get my lazy, worthless ass out of bed or I’ll end up like that homeless, bag lady in the park!”  
  
这就是回忆中这种反应是如何发生的。幸存者醒来时感到抑郁。因为童年经历使她相信在这种状态下自己是不值得和不被接受的，她感到焦虑和羞愧。这反过来又激活了她内心的批评者，用完美主义的责备来吓唬她：“难怪没有人喜欢我。我得从床上爬起来，否则我会变成公园里那个无家可归的、提着包的老女人！”

Retraumatized by her own inner voice, she then launches into her most habitual 4F behavior. She either lashes out domineeringly at the nearest person \[Fight\] – or she launches busily into anxious productivity \[Flight\] – or she flips on the TV and foggily tunes out or dozes off again \[Freeze\] – or she self-abandoningly redirects her attention to figuring out how to fix a friend’s problem \[Fawn\].  
  
被自己的内心声音重新创伤，她随后开始她最习惯的 4F 行为。她要么对最近的人咄咄逼人地发火\[战斗\]——要么她忙碌地投入到焦虑的生产力中\[逃跑\]——要么她打开电视，模糊地调出频道或再次打盹\[冻结\]——要么她自我放弃地转移注意力，去想办法解决朋友的麻烦\[讨好\]。

All this typically happens so quickly that we do not notice the fear and shame, or the inner critic. The first thing that we usually begin to notice in early recovery is that suddenly we are engaged in our most typical 4F response. As recovery progresses we become aware of the critic. Eventually this promotes mindfulness of the fear and shame that fuel the critic. And finally in later recovery, we become aware of the abandonment depression itself.  
  
所有这些通常都发生得非常快，以至于我们没有注意到恐惧和羞愧，或者内心的批评。在早期康复中，我们通常开始注意到的是，我们突然陷入了最典型的 4F 反应。随着康复的进展，我们开始意识到批评的存在。最终，这促进了我们对恐惧和羞愧的觉察，这些恐惧和羞愧是批评的燃料。最后，在康复的后期，我们开始意识到被遗弃的抑郁本身。

Unfortunately this dynamic also commonly operates in reverse. This can occur in early recovery when you suddenly notice that you have slipped back into a dysfunctional 4F behavior. This then [[null|]]triggers you into new self-attacking criticism, which then amps up your fear and shame. This in turn increases your abandonment depression _as the process of self-abandonment runs riot._  
  
不幸的是，这种动态也常常反向运作。这可能在早期康复时发生，当你突然注意到自己又回到了功能失调的 4F 行为。这会触发你进入新的自我攻击性批评，这进而加剧了你的恐惧和羞愧。这反过来又增加了你的被遗弃抑郁，因为自我遗弃的过程变得失控。

Desperate to escape the deathlike feelings of the abandonment depression, the initial cycle revs up again. Depression creates fear and shame which fuels venomous critic attacks and launches you into fighting, fleeing, freezing or fawning.  
  
为了逃离被遗弃抑郁的死亡般的感觉，最初的循环再次加速。抑郁创造了恐惧和羞愧，这加剧了毒蛇般的批评攻击，让你陷入战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好。

Survivors can careen back and forth through these layered reactions creating perpetual motion cycles of internal trauma.  
  
幸存者可以在这些层层反应中来回穿梭，创造出永无止境的内部创伤循环。

I believe this process also accounts for the spiraling down feeling that many survivors report having during intense flashbacks.  
  
我相信这个过程也解释了许多幸存者在强烈的闪回中报告的螺旋式下降的感觉。
