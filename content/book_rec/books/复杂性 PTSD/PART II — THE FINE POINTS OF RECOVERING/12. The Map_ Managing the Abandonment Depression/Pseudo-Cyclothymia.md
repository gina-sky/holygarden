**Pseudo-Cyclothymia  
  
伪环性情绪障碍**

On a parallel with false hunger, feeling tired is sometimes unrelated to sleep deprivation. It is instead an emotional experience of the abandonment depression. I believe that emotional tiredness comes from not resting enough in a safe relationship with yourself or with another. This emotional exhaustion often masquerades as physiological tiredness. Unfortunately, over time, the two can become confusingly intertwined.  
  
与虚假的饥饿感平行，感到疲倦有时与睡眠不足无关。它反而是一种被遗弃的抑郁情绪体验。我相信情绪上的疲倦来自于在与自己或他人的安全关系中休息不足。这种情绪上的疲惫常常伪装成生理上的疲倦。不幸的是，随着时间的推移，这两者可能会变得混淆不清。

When our abandonment depression is unremediated, either kind of tiredness can trigger us into fear. This then activates the [[null|]]inner critic which then translates “tired” into “endangering imperfection,” which in turn triggers us into a 4F response.  
  
当我们的放弃抑郁未得到治疗时，任何一种疲劳都可能引发我们的恐惧。这随后激活了内心的批评家，将“疲劳”转化为“危险的缺陷”，进而引发我们的 4F 反应。

Ironically, over-reacting to emotional tiredness eventually creates real physical exhaustion via a process I call The Cyclothymic Two-Step. _The cyclothymic two-step_ is the dance of flight types or subtypes who habitually overreact to their tiredness with workaholic or busyholic activity. Self-medicating with their own adrenalin, they “run” to counteract the emotional tiredness of the unprocessed abandonment depression.  
  
讽刺的是，过度反应情绪疲劳最终会通过我称之为循环性双步法的过程导致真正的身体疲惫。循环性双步法是那些习惯性地用工作狂或忙碌狂活动来过度反应自己疲劳的逃避型或亚型的人的舞蹈。他们用自身的肾上腺素自我治疗，通过“奔跑”来对抗未处理的放弃抑郁带来的情绪疲劳。

Eventually however, many exhaust themselves physically, and become temporarily too depleted or sick to continue running. At such times, they collapse into an accumulated depression so painful, that they re-launch desperately into “flight-speed” at the first sign of replenished adrenalin. Survivors with this pattern sometimes misdiagnose themselves as bipolar because of their abrupt vacillations between adrenalin highs and abandonment-exacerbated lows.  
  
然而，最终许多人会因身体疲惫而耗尽精力，变得暂时过于虚弱或生病，无法继续奔跑。在这样的时刻，他们会陷入一种累积的痛苦抑郁中，以至于在肾上腺素补充的第一迹象下，他们会绝望地重新启动“逃跑速度”。具有这种模式的幸存者有时会误诊自己为双相情感障碍，因为他们会在肾上腺素高峰和放弃加剧的低谷之间突然波动。

Also noteworthy here is the futile journey that many survivors undergo treating emotional tiredness with physiologically-based methods. The limited efficacy of such an approach however typically augments their shame: “What’s wrong with me. I’ve changed everything in my diet and in my sleep and exercise regimen. I’ve taken every available supplement and seen every type of practitioner imaginable, and I still wake up feeling dead tired.”  
  
也值得关注的是，许多幸存者在用基于生理的方法治疗情绪疲劳的过程中所经历的徒劳之旅。然而，这种方法的有限效果通常加剧了他们的羞愧感：“我到底怎么了。我已经改变了我的一切饮食、睡眠和锻炼计划。我尝试了所有可用的补充剂，见过所有能想到的治疗师，但我仍然醒来时感到极度疲惫。”

There is a healthy way out of this cul-de-sac of misdirected striving. It lies in cultivating self-kindness during those inevitable times when you feel tired, bad, lonely, or depressed. In this regard, the notable AA 12 Step acronym, HALT - Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired – can be helpful. Accordingly, I recommend that you focus inside to see if you have flashed back into the abandonment depression whenever you experience a HALT feeling. If you have, you can then work to generate the internal, self-compassionate attention described above.  
  
有一条健康的出路可以摆脱这种误入歧途的努力的死胡同。这在于在那些不可避免的感到疲倦、糟糕、孤独或抑郁的时候培养自我善意。在这方面，著名的 AA 12 步格言 HALT——饥饿、愤怒、孤独、疲倦——可以有所帮助。因此，我建议你在体验 HALT 感觉时，关注内心是否闪回了被遗弃的抑郁。如果你有，那么你可以努力产生上述描述的内部、自我同情关注。
