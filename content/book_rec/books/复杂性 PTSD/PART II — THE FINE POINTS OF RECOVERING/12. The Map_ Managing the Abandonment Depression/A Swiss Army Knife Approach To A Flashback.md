\*\*A Swiss Army Knife Approach To A Flashback

应对闪回的瑞士军刀式方法\*\*

This is a final example of addressing all the layers of reactivity in resolving a flashback.

这是解决闪回中所有反应层的一个最终例子。

When I started this work over three decades ago, I ate very poorly and did not know how to soothe and nurture myself with healthy food.

当我三十年前开始这项工作时，我饮食非常糟糕，不知道如何用健康食品来安抚和滋养自己。

After some years of recovery work however, I deeply intuited that I needed to cook more in order to take self-nurturance to the next level. I had not cooked more however because I hated to cook. Luckily I embraced cooking anyway as a labor of love. Nonetheless cooking was, for a long time, a very trying and unpleasant experience for me. \[This was, in fact, much like my many years of struggling to get the upper hand on the critic\].

然而，经过几年的恢复工作后，我深刻地直觉到，我需要更多地烹饪，以便将自我滋养提升到下一个层次。然而，我没有更多地烹饪，因为我讨厌烹饪。幸运的是，我仍然将烹饪视为一种爱的劳动。尽管如此，烹饪在我很长时间里都是一个非常艰难和令人不愉快的经历。\[这实际上就像我多年来努力克服批评家的过程一样\]。

[[null|]]But back to cooking which became a central piece of my self-remothering work. It was not until I understood more about the dynamics of my flight response that I realized how much I rushed around when I was cooking. Via increased mindfulness, I discovered that the smallest unforeseen obstacle could set off what felt like a small electric shock in my chest. Examples of these obstacles include something spilled, a lid too tight to open, an extra unanticipated task, or the clock showing me that I was behind schedule. In an instant, anyone of these normal hindrances could send me rushing around the kitchen in a low grade panic. Whenever this occurred, I would then inhale my meal as soon as it was ready just to get the ordeal over with.

但回到烹饪，这成为我自我母亲化工作的核心部分。直到我更多地了解了我的逃避反应的动态，我才意识到我在烹饪时有多匆忙。通过提高正念，我发现最小的意外障碍会在我的胸中引发一种类似小电击的感觉。这些障碍的例子包括某物洒了、盖子太紧打不开、额外的意外任务，或者时钟显示我落后了进度。瞬间，这些正常的阻碍中的任何一个都可能让我在厨房里慌乱地四处奔走。每当这种情况发生时，我就会一做好饭就赶紧吃掉，只是为了结束这场磨难。

This is an example of what a common, everyday flashback looks like in adulthood. It is so often minor daily frustrations that trigger us into flashbacks, rather than incidents that repeat the gross insults and ordeals of our childhoods.

这是成年后常见的日常闪回的一个例子。往往是一些微不足道的日常挫折会触发我们回想起过去，而不是重复我们童年时的侮辱和磨难。

With ongoing recovery work, I realized that anything to do with food could easily flash me back to the family dinner table - the battlefield of my dysfunctional family.

随着持续的治疗工作，我意识到与食物有关的事情很容易让我回想起家庭餐桌——我那功能失调家庭的战场。

Many productive grieving sessions came out of this. They lead me to an epiphany that doing anything intricate with lot of steps to it also flashed me back to feeling picked apart by my parents. I subsequently discovered that angering at my parents, whenever I was triggered by doing something complicated, significantly reduced my fear.

许多有成效的哀悼会由此产生。它们引导我领悟到，做任何复杂且步骤繁多的事情也会让我回想起被父母拆散的感觉。随后我发现，当我被复杂的事情触发时，对父母感到愤怒可以显著减少我的恐惧。

There was, however, a huge part of my food trauma that I could not shrink until I started the somatic work described in this chapter.

然而，直到我开始进行本章描述的躯体工作，我那部分与食物有关的创伤才得以缩小。

Since then, years of practicing somatic mindfulness has greatly reduced my hair-triggerable anxiety around cooking. This is however still a work in progress. In terms of the cycles of reactivity, my occasional flashbacks around food and food preparation can look like this. I have thirty minutes to cook and eat my breakfast before I leave for work. I come into the kitchen and… “Oh No, The sink is [[null|]]full of the dishes that I forgot to clean last night!” I immediately notice that I am about to launch into frenzied dish washing, when Flashback Management Step# 1 rises to the front of my consciousness. “I am having a flashback.”

自那以后，多年的身体正念练习大大减少了我对烹饪的易怒焦虑。然而，这仍然是一个正在进行中的工作。在反应周期的方面，我偶尔关于食物和食物准备的闪回可能看起来是这样的。我离开工作前有三十分钟的时间来烹饪和吃早餐。我走进厨房，...“哦不，水槽里都是我昨晚忘记洗的盘子！”我立刻意识到我即将陷入狂乱的洗碗状态，这时闪回管理步骤#1 浮现在我的意识中。“我正在经历闪回。”

I go directly to Step# 7 and attempt to “ease back into my body.” I sit in my favorite stuffed chair, close my eyes, and bring my awareness to my abdomen, where my anxiety typically makes its most strident charge. I can feel tightness in and just below my diaphragm. I feel afraid and get a picture of my father’s big hand squeezing my small intestines.

我直接跳到步骤#7，尝试“回到我的身体。”我坐在我最喜欢的填充椅子上，闭上眼睛，将我的意识带到我的腹部，那里我的焦虑通常最为强烈。我感觉到我的膈膜处和下方有紧张感。我感到害怕，脑海中浮现出我父亲的大手挤压我的小肠的画面。

I start to hypochondriasize about the possible long term effects of having this tension in my abdomen. My mindfulness instantly alerts me to invoke the thought-correction of Step# 8. I slowly repeat my current favorite anti-endangerment mantra: “I am safe; I am relaxing.”

我开始担心这种腹部紧张可能带来的长期影响。我的正念立刻提醒我调用第 8 步的思想纠正。我慢慢地重复我最喜欢的反危险咒语：“我安全；我在放松。”

I slow and deepen my breath, and feel the muscles in my belly as much as I can. I feel the slow cycle of these muscles relaxing and contracting with the ebbing and flowing of my breath. The cycle gradually becomes more fluid as I attend to it.

我放慢并加深呼吸，尽可能地感受我的腹部肌肉。我感觉到这些肌肉随着我的呼吸的起伏而缓慢地放松和收缩。当我专注于它时，这个循环逐渐变得更加流畅。

After about fifty inhalations, I feel a swollen sensation of tiredness diffusing like ink throughout my body. My gut momentarily retightens to ward off that awful deadening feeling of the abandonment depression.

大约五十次吸气后，我感觉到一种肿胀的疲惫感像墨水一样在我全身扩散。我的肠道暂时收紧，以抵御那种可怕的麻木感，这是放弃抑郁的感觉。

But I surrender to the deadness. I do this because I know the tight feeling is fear and that it will soon morph into the screaming critic excoriating me about being late. I say no to the critic’s Siren call of “you can do this if you hurry,” tempting me back into flight.

但我屈服于这种麻木。我这样做是因为我知道那种紧张感是恐惧，而且它很快就会变成尖叫的批评家，责备我迟到。我拒绝批评家的海妖般的诱惑，她说“如果你快点，你可以做到”，试图让我重新回到逃避的状态。

I stay with the deadened, tired, lifeless feeling and try to feel it more, welcoming it. I sense myself beginning to become one with the depressed sensation.

我停留在那种麻木、疲惫、无力的感觉中，试图更加感受它，欢迎它。我感觉到自己开始与那种沮丧的感觉融为一体。

Because I am so well practiced, the depression starts to gradually morph into a widening sense of relaxation. It spreads throughout my body, and my body begins to feel like an easy-chair.

因为我已经非常熟练，抑郁开始逐渐转变为一种越来越宽泛的放松感。这种感觉遍布我的全身，我的身体开始感觉像一把舒适的躺椅。

[[null|]]I look at my watch and it has taken twenty minutes of my “precious time.” I realize my critic is trying to sneak back in and is goading me with the remark “it has taken twenty minutes of my precious time.”

我看了一眼我的手表，它已经占用了我二十分钟的“宝贵时间”。我意识到我的批评家正试图悄悄溜回来，并用“它已经占用了我二十分钟的宝贵时间”这句话来刺激我。

I disidentify from the critic and shift into my refathering self and thought-correct the critic. “It’s ok Pete, this is all small potatoes. You are not in danger \[Step# 2\], and this is definitely no emergency.”

我与评论者产生分歧，转而回归我的反思自我，并纠正评论者的观点。“皮特，这都没什么大不了的。你并不危险\[步骤# 2\]，这绝对不是紧急情况。”

I take a moment with the angering part of grieving \[Step#9\] and reinforce my boundaries against my internalized parents. “Screw you Helen \[mom\] and Charlie \[dad\] for frightening me so much about making mistakes that I freak out when things don’t go perfectly!

我花一点时间处理悲伤中令人愤怒的部分，并加强我对内化的父母的界限。“去你的，海伦\[妈妈\]和查理\[爸爸\]，你们让我如此害怕犯错误，以至于事情不完美时我会慌乱！”

“Ooh, that got a few nice tears. What a relief. How many times have I been stuck in that driven-ness and not known how to stop?!”

哦，这让我流了几滴泪。真是个解脱。我多少次陷入那种驱动力中，却不知道如何停下来？！

I return to thought-correction. “So, like I was saying Pete, it’s ok. You always show up at your office an hour early anyway. You can take 20 minutes off the routine. You can stay in this relaxed state a bit longer and still have time to get everything done in a relaxed manner.”

我回到思维纠正的话题。“所以，就像我之前说的，皮特，没关系。你本来就会提前一个小时到办公室。你可以从常规中抽出 20 分钟。你可以在这放松的状态下多待一会儿，同时还能有时间以轻松的方式完成所有事情。”

I feel the sense of triumph I sometimes see in my clients when they have worked hard to successfully manage and resolve a flashback. “It worked!” This time I broke the cycle and did not let my triggered flight response get much further than some momentary rushing.

我感受到客户在努力成功管理和解决闪回时有时在我身上看到的胜利感。“有效了！”这次我打破了循环，没有让我的触发飞行反应进一步发展成一些短暂的慌乱。

I stopped the cycle of reactivity from devolving into an inner critic diatribe against myself. I didn’t indulge the outer critic and let it make me try to pin the undone dishes on my wife. I chose to stay with the depression. I bypassed the shame and fear that I have gotten stuck in ten thousand times before when I could not accept my current state of being. I refused to abandon myself like the sinking ship I thought I was – like Helen and Charlie abandoned me as a kid on a daily, hourly, yearly basis.

我阻止了反应性循环恶化成对自己内心的批评。我没有纵容外在的批评，让它让我试图把未洗的餐具归咎于我的妻子。我选择与抑郁共存。我绕过了那种羞耻和恐惧，那是我以前无数次陷入的，当我无法接受自己的当前状态时。我拒绝像我认为的那样放弃自己——就像海伦和查理在我小时候每天、每小时、每年都抛弃我一样。

[[null|]]I am also happy to report that I now cook regularly, and triggering is relatively rare. I have even gotten to enjoy my own cooking so much that I rarely eat out.

我也很高兴地报告，我现在经常做饭，触发的情况相对较少。我甚至喜欢自己的烹饪如此之多，以至于我很少外出就餐。
