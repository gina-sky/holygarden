\*\*Somatic Awareness Can Therapeutically Trigger Painful Memories

身体意识可以治疗性地触发痛苦的记忆\*\*

Somatic awareness and sensate focusing sometimes opens up memories and unworked through feelings of grief about your childhood abuse and neglect. This phenomenon provides invaluable, [[null|]]therapeutic opportunities to more fully grieve the losses of childhood. If more pain comes up then you can digest on your own, please consider getting someone more experienced to help you with this process.

身体意识和感官聚焦有时会打开关于你童年虐待和忽视的未处理的悲伤记忆。这种现象为更充分地哀悼童年的损失提供了无价的治疗机会。如果你感到更多的痛苦，你可以自己消化，但请考虑寻求更有经验的人来帮助你处理这个过程。

With considerable practice, you can begin to exhume from your fear an awareness of the underlying sensations of depression. These are _hypo-aroused_ sensations that are subtle and barely perceptible at first. They may include heaviness, swollenness, exhaustion, emptiness, hunger, longing, soreness, or deadness.

经过相当多的练习，你开始可以从恐惧中挖掘出对抑郁潜在感觉的意识。这些是低唤醒的感觉，一开始微妙而几乎不可察觉。它们可能包括沉重、肿胀、疲惫、空虚、饥饿、渴望、疼痛或麻木。

These sensations are initially as difficult to stay present to as those of fear. With ongoing practice however, focused attention also digests them as they are integrated into consciousness. One of the biggest challenges of mindfully focusing on depression is to not dissociate into sleep. Sitting up straight in a comfortable chair can help to keep you awake and focused on fully feeling and metabolizing your depression.

这些感觉最初与恐惧一样难以保持专注。然而，随着持续的练习，专注的注意力也会消化它们，因为它们被整合到意识中。在正念地关注抑郁时，最大的挑战之一是不要分心进入睡眠。坐在舒适的椅子上可以帮助你保持清醒，并专注于完全感受和代谢你的抑郁。

As practice becomes more accomplished, these feelings and sensations of depression can morph into a sense of peace, relaxation and ease. On special occasions, they sometimes open to an underlying, innate _core emotional experience_ of clarity, well-being and belonging.

随着练习的熟练，这些抑郁的感觉和感受可以转变为平静、放松和舒适的感觉。在特殊场合，它们有时会打开一个潜在的天生核心情感体验，即清晰、幸福和归属感。
