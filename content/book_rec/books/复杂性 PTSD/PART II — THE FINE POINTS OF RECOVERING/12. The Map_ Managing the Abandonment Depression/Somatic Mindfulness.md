**Somatic Mindfulness  
  
躯体正念**

Because depression in Cptsd commonly morphs instantly into fear, early mindfulness work involves staying present to the physical sensations of fearful hyperarousal. This technique is also known as _sensate focusing_ and it is the practice of _feeling_ we explored in the last chapter. Mild sensations of fear are muscular tightness or tension anywhere in the body, especially in the alimentary canal. Tension in the jaw, throat, chest, diaphragm or belly also often correlates with fear. More intense sensations of fear are nausea, jumpiness, feeling wired, shortness of breath, hyperventilation, and alimentary distress.  
  
因为创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）中的抑郁通常瞬间转变为恐惧，早期的正念练习涉及保持对恐惧过度警觉的身体感觉的当下。这种技术也被称为感觉集中，是我们上一章探讨的感觉练习。轻微的恐惧感觉是身体任何部位的肌肉紧张或紧张，尤其是在消化系统中。颚部、喉咙、胸部、横膈膜或腹部的紧张也常与恐惧相关。更强烈的恐惧感觉包括恶心、紧张不安、感觉兴奋、呼吸急促、过度换气以及消化不适。 正念还涉及注意到心理从这些不舒服的感觉中分离出来的倾向。再次强调，分离可以是经典的右脑分心，即陷入幻想或睡眠，或者是左脑的认知分心，即担忧和强迫。

Mindfulness also involves noticing the psyche’s penchant to dissociate from these uncomfortable sensations. Once again, dissociation can be the classical right-brain distraction of spacing out into reverie or sleep, or the left-brain, cognitive distraction of worrying and obsessing.

Over and over, the survivor will need to rescue himself from dissociation, and gently bring his awareness back into fully feeling the sensations of his fear. Although sensations of fear sometimes feel unbearable at first, persistent focusing with non-reactive attention dissolves and resolves them as if awareness itself is digesting and integrating them.  
  
一次又一次，幸存者需要从解离中拯救自己，并温柔地将他的意识带回到完全感受恐惧的感觉。虽然恐惧的感觉一开始有时会感觉难以忍受，但持续的非反应性关注会将它们消解和解决，就像意识本身在消化和整合它们一样。
