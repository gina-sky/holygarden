\*\*Depressed Thinking Versus Feeling Depressed

抑郁思维与感到抑郁\*\*

Healing progresses when we learn to distinguish depressed thinking \[which we need to eliminate\] from depressed feeling \[which we sometimes need to feel\]. Occasional feelings of listlessness and anhedonia \[inability to enjoy our usual pleasures\] are normal and existential. A modicum of ennui and dissatisfaction are part of the price of admission to life.

当我们学会区分抑郁的思考（我们需要消除的）和抑郁的感觉（有时我们需要体验的）时，康复就会进展。偶尔的冷漠和无快感感\[无法享受我们通常的乐趣\]是正常和存在的。一点点的厌倦和不满意是进入生活的代价之一。

Moreover, depression is sometimes an invaluable herald of the need to slow down for rest and restoration. When depression is most helpful, it gives us access to a unique spring of intuition, such as that which informs us that a once valued job or relationship is no longer healthy for us. In such instances we feel depressed because some irreparable change has rendered some central thing in our lives detrimental to us. This functional depression is signaling us to let it die and move on.

此外，抑郁有时是提醒我们放慢脚步、休息和恢复的宝贵信号。当抑郁最有帮助时，它为我们打开了一个独特的直觉源泉，比如那些告诉我们曾经珍视的工作或关系对我们已不再健康的信息。在这种情况下，我们感到抑郁，因为某些不可修复的变化使我们的生活中心事物对我们有害。这种功能性的抑郁在告诉我们让它消亡并继续前进。

Overreaction to depression essentially reinforces learned toxic shame. It reinforces the person’s belief that he is unworthy, defective and unlovable when he is depressed.

对抑郁的过度反应本质上强化了习得的毒性羞愧。它强化了一个人在抑郁时认为自己不值得、有缺陷和不可爱的信念。

Sadly this typically drives him deeper into abandonment-exacerbating isolation.

遗憾的是，这通常会使他陷入加剧被遗弃的孤立。
