\*\*Theoretical Neuroscience Of Verbal Ventilation

言语宣泄的理论神经科学\*\*

Verbal ventilation is a tool that can remediate brain changes that are caused by Cptsd. Susan Vaughan’s MRI research demonstrates that emotional flashbacks over-activate the emotionally oriented right-brain and under-activate the thinking-oriented left-brain. With this hemispheric polarization, there is an overwhelming reemergence of childhood pain that is emotionally remembered by the memory-oriented right-brain. At the same time, the survivor loses access to the higher cognitive functions of her left-brain. This temporary loss of cognitive perspective explains why it is so hard for a survivor to realize that she is only flashing back, and not really lost in the danger, helplessness and hopelessness of the past.

言语宣泄是一种可以纠正由创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）引起的脑部变化的工具。苏珊·沃恩的 MRI 研究表明，情绪闪回会过度激活情绪导向的右脑，而低估了思维导向的左脑。在这种半球极化中，童年痛苦在记忆导向的右脑中被情感性地重新浮现。同时，幸存者失去了左脑的高级认知功能。这种暂时的认知视角丧失解释了为什么幸存者如此难以意识到她只是在闪回，而不是真正迷失在过去危险的、无助的和绝望中。

Verbal ventilation, at its most potent, is the therapeutic process of bringing left-brain cognition to intense right-brain emotional activation. It fosters the recoveree’s ability to put words to feelings, and ultimately to accurately interpret and communicate about his various feeling states. When this process is repeated sufficiently, new neural pathways grow that allow the left- and right-brain to work together so that the person can actually think and feel at the same time.

言语释放，在其最强大的时候，是将左脑认知与强烈的右脑情绪激活相结合的治疗过程。它促进了康复者将语言与情感联系起来的能力，并最终能够准确解释和传达他各种情感状态。当这个过程反复进行足够多次时，新的神经通路就会生长，使左右脑能够协同工作，从而使个人能够真正同时思考和感受。

The corpus callosum is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres. Research shows that the corpus callosum is smaller in some Cptsd survivors. Further research shows that the brain can generate new neurons and new neuronal connections to remedy this situation.

胼胝体是连接大脑左右半球的脑部部分。研究表明，一些创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）幸存者的胼胝体较小。进一步的研究表明，大脑可以生成新的神经元和新的神经元连接来弥补这种情况。
