\*\*4\. Feeling: Passively Working Through Grief

4\. 感觉：被动地处理哀悼\*\*

“Feeling is the antithesis of pain…the more pain one feels, the less pain one suffers”

“感觉是痛苦的相反……一个人感觉到的痛苦越多，遭受的痛苦就越少。”

Ongoing engagement in the active grieving processes of angering, crying and verbal ventilation can help us to discover the fourth grieving process: Feeling.

持续参与愤怒、哭泣和言语宣泄的主动哀悼过程，可以帮助我们发现第四个哀悼过程：感受。

_Feeling_ is a subtler, passive process than emoting. It is best illustrated by contrasting the concepts of emoting and feeling. Emoting is when we cry, anger out, or verbally ventilate the energy of an inner emotional experience. Feeling, on the other hand, is the inactive process of staying present to internal emotional experience without reacting. In recovery then, feeling is surrendering to our internal experiences of pain without judging or resisting them, and without emoting them out.

感受是一种比情绪表达更为微妙、被动的过程。它最好通过对比情绪表达和感受的概念来阐述。情绪表达是我们哭泣、愤怒或用言语宣泄内心情绪体验的能量。而感受，另一方面，是一种不采取行动的过程，即保持对内心情绪体验的当下存在，而不做出反应。因此，在康复过程中，感受就是放弃对痛苦的内心体验进行评判或抵抗，而不将其情绪表达出来。

Feeling is a kinesthetic rather than a cognitive experience. It is the process of shifting the focus of your awareness off of thinking and onto your affects, energetic states and sensations. It is the proverbial “getting out of your head” and “getting into your body.”

感受是一种动觉而非认知体验。它是将你的意识焦点从思考转移到你的情感、能量状态和感觉上的过程。这就是所谓的“走出你的头脑”和“进入你的身体”。

[[null|]]As a grieving process, feeling involves consciously reversing the learned survival mechanism of clamping down on pain to banish it from awareness.

作为一种哀悼过程，感受涉及有意识地逆转学会的抑制痛苦以将其从意识中排除的生存机制。

Feeling “occurs” when we direct our attention to an emotionally or physically painful state, and surrender to this experience without resistance. When we relax acceptingly into our pain, we can learn to gently absorb it into our experience. Feeling then functions as if our awareness is a solvent that dissolves and metabolizes the affect, energy and sensation of our emotions.

当我们把注意力集中在情感或身体上的痛苦状态，并顺从于这种体验而不抵抗时，“感受”就会发生。当我们放松地接受我们的痛苦，我们可以学会温柔地将其吸收到我们的体验中。此时，感受就像我们的意识是一种溶剂，它溶解和代谢我们情绪的影响、能量和感觉。
