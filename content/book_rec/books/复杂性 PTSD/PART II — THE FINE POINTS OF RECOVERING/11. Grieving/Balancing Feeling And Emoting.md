\*\*Balancing Feeling And Emoting

感受与表达之间的平衡\*\*

When we become more mindful of the subtle sensations of feelings, the passive grieving process of feeling through them complements [[null|]]the active processes of grieving them out. We are typically in advanced recovery when we can both emote out and feel through our anger, sadness, fear, shame and depression.

当我们更加关注感受的微妙感觉时，通过感受它们的被动哀悼过程与表达它们的积极过程相辅相成。当我们能够既表达又感受我们的愤怒、悲伤、恐惧、羞愧和抑郁时，我们通常处于高级康复阶段。

Furthermore, _feeling_ also helps us to bring emotions into awareness that need to be grieved out through active, cathartic emoting. Thus, grieving is especially profound when we can fluidly shift between feeling and emoting. Sometimes we will only need to fully feel and accept the sensations of our pain. Other times we will want to verbally ventilate about our pain with someone who gives us full permission to color our words with angering and tears.

此外，感觉还能帮助我们意识到需要通过积极的、宣泄的情感表达来哀悼的情感。因此，当我们能够流畅地在感觉和情感表达之间切换时，哀悼尤为深刻。有时我们只需要完全感受和接受我们痛苦的感受。其他时候，我们可能想要与一个完全允许我们用愤怒和泪水来修饰话语的人口头宣泄我们的痛苦。
