**Verbally Ventilating Alone  
  
独自进行言语宣泄**

Verbally venting alone, where no one else can hear you, is a helpful therapeutic technique. Untraumatized children do it frequently in [[null|]]their play, much to their great benefit. If your room is not private, you can drive your car to somewhere that is.  
  
口头宣泄，在没有他人能听到你的地方，是一种有益的治疗技巧。未受创伤的儿童在玩耍时经常这样做，这对他们大有裨益。如果你的房间不私密，你可以开车去一个私密的地方。

Typically it takes considerable silencing of the critic to regain this therapeutic tool. This tool is so powerful and restorative that it is worth many skirmishes with the critic to reclaim it for your Cptsd toolbox.  
  
通常需要相当程度的抑制批评者才能重新获得这种治疗工具。这个工具如此强大和恢复力，值得与批评者进行多次小冲突，以将其纳入你的 Cptsd 工具箱。

One of my clients kept an 18” length of rubber hose and a phone book on the passenger seat of her car. During the year that she was doing the lion’s share of her anger work, she would hit the hose loudly on the phonebook whenever her brainwashing, abusive father came up in her mind. She would of course pull over for this, and found over time that she could do it inconspicuously in places with surprisingly limited privacy. It was remarkable to me how much critic-shrinking she did in that year.  
  
我的一个客户在她的车上乘客座位上放了一根 18 英寸长的橡胶软管和一本电话簿。在她进行大部分愤怒工作的那一年，每当她想起被洗脑、虐待的父亲时，她就会用力将软管敲在电话簿上。她当然会为此停车，并且随着时间的推移发现，她可以在隐私非常有限的地方悄悄地这样做。对我来说，她那一年批评者缩小的情况非常引人注目。
