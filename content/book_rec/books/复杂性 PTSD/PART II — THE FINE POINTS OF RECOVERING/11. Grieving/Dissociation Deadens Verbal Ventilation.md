\*\*Dissociation Deadens Verbal Ventilation

解离使口头宣泄变得迟钝\*\*

It is important to differentiate verbal ventilation from dissociative flights of fantasy and obsessive bouts of unproductive worrying. Dissociation is a defense that children develop to distract and protect themselves from the overwhelming pain of their abandonment. As unsupported children, we have to dissociate because we are not able to effectively grieve. We have to protect ourselves by not allowing the full brunt of our pain into awareness.

重要的是要区分言语宣泄与解离性幻想和强迫性的无益担忧。解离是一种儿童为了分散注意力并保护自己免受被遗弃的痛苦而发展出的防御机制。作为没有得到支持的孩子，我们必须解离，因为我们无法有效地哀悼。我们必须通过不让我们的痛苦完全进入意识来保护自己。

As we saw in [[6. What is My Trauma Type_|chapter 6]], there are two common types of dissociation: right-brain dissociation and left-brain dissociation.

正如我们在第 6 章中看到的，有两种常见的解离类型：右脑解离和左脑解离。

_Right-brain dissociation_ can be seen as classical dissociation and as the defense most common to freeze types. It is the right-brain process of numbing out against intense feeling or incessant inner critic attack. Dissociation is once again a process of distraction. Survivors commonly experience it as getting lost in fantasy, fogginess, TV, tiredness or sleep.

右脑解离可以被视为经典解离，也是冻结类型最常见的防御机制。它是右脑通过麻木来对抗强烈情感或持续的内心批评攻击的过程。解离再次是一种分散注意力的过程。幸存者通常将其体验为迷失在幻想中、模糊感、看电视、疲劳或睡眠。

[[null|]]Verbally reporting from a place of self-distraction is in fact the opposite of verbal ventilation. Getting lost in daydream-like descriptions of improbable salvation fantasies is a common way that clients avoid their pain in a therapy session. Another common example is recounting long elaborate dreams that are devoid of emotional content or serious attempts at introspection.

口头报告来自自我分心的地方实际上与口头宣泄相反。在治疗过程中，客户通过陷入类似白日梦的、不可能的救赎幻想的描述来避免他们的痛苦是一种常见方式。另一个常见例子是讲述那些缺乏情感内容或缺乏深刻反思的长篇详尽的梦境。

Early in my career, I worked briefly with a freeze-fight type client who was stuck in an avoidance process of endlessly monologing about her dreams. Dina recalled them in lifeless, excruciating detail. In fact, her deadened delivery was emblematic of the way she talked about almost everything.

在我职业生涯的早期，我短暂地与一位陷入逃避过程的冷冻-战斗型客户合作过。她不停地独白关于她的梦境。Dina 以毫无生气的、痛苦的细节回忆起它们。事实上，她那死气沉沉的表达方式是她谈论几乎所有事情的方式的象征。

Dina was an intern-therapist who locked up her vulnerability with a belief that dream work was the _piece de resistance_ of therapy. My attempts to guide her into exploring her deeper underlying experience were routinely met with the hackles of her fight response. I was unfortunately not experienced enough at the time to help her see that this was a dissociative defense that she had constructed as a child to protect herself from a very intrusive mother. Sadly, she left therapy disgruntled and still trapped in the isolation that was born of alienating others with her distant, abstract and non-interactive dissertations.

Dina 是一位实习治疗师，她用信念锁住了自己的脆弱，认为梦境分析是治疗中的精华。我试图引导她探索更深层次的内在体验，但她的战斗反应总是让我碰壁。当时我经验不足，无法帮助她意识到这其实是一种她作为孩子为了保护自己免受母亲过度干涉而构建的解离性防御。遗憾的是，她带着不满离开了治疗，仍然被困在因与他人疏远、抽象和非互动的论文而生出的孤立中。
