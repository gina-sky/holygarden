\*\*An Exercise In Feeling

感受练习\*\*

Here is an exercise to help you enhance your ability to feel and grieve through pain. Visualize yourself as time-traveling back to a place in the past when you felt especially abandoned. See your adult [[null|]]self taking your abandoned child onto your lap and comforting her in various painful emotional states or situations. You can comfort her/him verbally: “I feel such sorrow that you were so abandoned and that you felt so alone so much of the time. I love you even more when you are stuck in this abandonment pain – especially because you had to endure it for so long with no one to comfort you. That shouldn’t have happened to you. It shouldn’t happen to any child. Let me comfort and hold you. You don’t have to rush to get over it. It is not your fault. You didn’t cause it and you’re not to blame. You don’t have to do anything. Just let me hold you. Take your time. I love you always and care about you no matter what.”

这里有一个练习，帮助你通过痛苦来感受和哀悼。想象自己穿越时空回到过去，回到一个你特别感到被遗弃的地方。看到你作为成年人，把被遗弃的孩子抱在膝上，安慰她在各种痛苦的情感状态或情境中。你可以用言语安慰她/他：“我感到如此悲伤，你被如此遗弃，你大部分时间都感到如此孤独。当你陷入这种遗弃的痛苦时，我更加爱你——尤其是因为你不得不忍受这么久，没有人安慰你。这不应该发生在你身上。这不应该发生在任何孩子身上。让我安慰你，抱住你。你不必急于走出这段经历。这不是你的错。你没有造成它，你也不应该受到责备。你不必做任何事情。只需让我抱住你。慢慢来。我永远爱你，无论发生什么我都关心你。”

I highly recommend practicing this even if it feels inauthentic, and even if it requires a great deal of fending off your critic. Keep practicing and eventually, you will have a genuine experience of feeling self-compassion for the traumatized child you were. When that occurs, you will know that your recovery work had reached a deep level.

我强烈推荐即使感觉不真实，即使需要大量抵制你的批评，也要练习这个方法。继续练习，最终，你将会有一个真实的体验，感受到对自己曾经受创伤的孩子的自我同情。当这种情况发生时，你就会知道你的康复工作已经达到了深层。
