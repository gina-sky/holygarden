\*\*Crying And Self-Compassion

哭泣与自我同情\*\*

When we greet our own tears with self-acceptance, crying awakens our develop- mentally arrested instinct of self-compassion. Once we establish self-compassion through consistent and repeated practice, it becomes the cornerstone of an increasing sense of self-esteem. When an attitude of self-compassion becomes habitual, it can instantly antidote the self-abandonment that so characterizes a flashback.

当我们以自我接纳的态度迎接自己的泪水时，哭泣唤醒了我们发展停滞的自我同情本能。一旦我们通过持续和反复的练习建立自我同情，它就成为自尊感不断增强的基石。当自我同情的姿态变得习惯时，它可以立即对抗闪回中如此典型的自我放弃。

Moreover self-compassion creates a foundation from which we can build authentic, intimacy-enhancing compassion for others. The depth of our ability to be there for an intimate generally depends on the depth of our capacity to practice unwavering allegiance to ourselves.

此外，自我同情为我们建立对他人的真实、增进亲密感的同情提供了一个基础。我们为亲密关系提供支持的深度通常取决于我们对自己坚定不移忠诚的深度。
