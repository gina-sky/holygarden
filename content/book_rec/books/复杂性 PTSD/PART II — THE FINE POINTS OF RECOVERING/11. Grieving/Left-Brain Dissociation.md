**Left-Brain Dissociation  
  
左脑解离**

_Left-brain dissociation_ is obsessiveness. Commonly, this ranges in severity from dwelling on a singular worry… to repetitively cycling through a list of worries… to panicky drasticizing and catastrophizing. This type of dissociation from internal pain strands the survivor in unhelpful ruminations about issues that are unrelated or minimally related to the true nature of her suffering.  
  
左脑解离是强迫症。通常，这种症状的严重程度从对单一担忧的沉迷……到反复循环一系列担忧……到恐慌性地夸大和灾难化。这种从内部痛苦中解离出来的方式，让幸存者陷入无益的沉思，关于与她真正痛苦本质无关或关系最小的问题。

This is an example of this. Your friend complains incessantly about the bad weather or the unfairness of people who do not use their turn signals. He cannot stop grumbling because no amount [[null|]]of complaining about the wrong thing releases the real pain that is driving his obsessive grievance. If he were able to look deeper at what is really troubling him, he might learn that his wife’s constructive feedback is continuously flashing him back into the fear and shame he felt when his mother verbally abused him.  
  
这是此类的一个例子。你的朋友不停地抱怨糟糕的天气或者那些不使用转向灯的人的不公平。他无法停止抱怨，因为无论抱怨多少关于错误的事情，都无法释放出驱使他不断抱怨的真正痛苦。如果他能够更深入地了解真正困扰他的问题，他可能会发现，他妻子建设性的反馈不断让他回到他母亲口头虐待他时所感受到的恐惧和羞耻。

Left-brain dissociation can also be a process of _trivialization_. This occurs when the survivor over-focuses on superficial external concerns to distract himself from upsetting inner experience. Becoming overly preoccupied with sports statistics or the lives of Hollywood celebrities are common examples of this. This is not, of course, to say that such interests are not worthwhile when they are pursued with moderation.  
  
左脑解离也可以是一个贬低的过程。这发生在幸存者过度关注表面外部问题，以分散自己从令人不安的内心体验中。过度关注体育统计数据或好莱坞名人的生活是这种行为的常见例子。当然，这并不是说，当这些兴趣适度追求时，它们就没有价值。

Finally, left-brain dissociation can also be seen in intellectualization. This is what the novelist, Ian McEwan, called the “high-walled fortress of focused thinking”. Some survivors over-rely on reasoning and lofty dialogue to protect themselves from the potentially messy and painful world of feeling. Even the highest levels of creative thinking can deteriorate into an obsessive defense when they are excessively engaged.  
  
最后，左脑分离现象也体现在理性化上。这就是小说家伊恩·麦克尤恩所说的“高墙堡垒般的专注思维”。一些幸存者过度依赖推理和高尚的对话来保护自己免受可能混乱和痛苦的情感世界的侵扰。即使是最高层次的创造性思维，如果过度投入，也可能变成一种强迫性的防御。
