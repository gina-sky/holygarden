**Learning To Feel  
  
学习感受**

As a survivor becomes more adept at angering and crying, fear of his feelings will decrease, and opportunities to learn to simply feel will present themselves. He can engage these opportunities by passively attuning to the more subtle sensations of his anger and sadness.  
  
随着幸存者越来越擅长愤怒和哭泣，对他感受的恐惧会减少，学习简单感受的机会也会出现。他可以通过被动地调整自己，去感受愤怒和悲伤的更微妙的感觉来把握这些机会。

Over time this practice will build his ability to stay passively present to the sensations of his deeper feelings – to his fear, shame and depression. But in early stages, this awareness will often morph into the need to actively emote them out – to grieve himself out of the abandonment mélange. Eventually, however, his abandonment mélange feelings will also be digested and worked through purely with the solvent of awareness. This also applies to anxiety which is often fear just below the level of awareness. With sufficient practice, anxiety can often be felt through passively. We will explore this process in greater depth in the [[12. The Map_ Managing the Abandonment Depression|next chapter]].  
  
随着时间的推移，这种练习将培养他被动地保持对更深层次感受的觉察——对他的恐惧、羞耻和抑郁。但在初期，这种觉察往往会转变为主动表达这些感受的需求——通过哀悼来摆脱被遗弃的混合情绪。然而，最终，被遗弃的混合情绪也会纯粹通过觉察的溶剂来消化和处理。这也适用于焦虑，它通常是处于觉察水平之下的恐惧。通过足够的练习，焦虑往往可以通过被动地感受。我们将在下一章更深入地探讨这个过程。
