**3\. Verbal Ventilation: The Golden Path To Intimacy  
  
3\. 语言释放：通往亲密的金色之路**

“Joy shared is doubled. Sorrow shared is halved.” - Old Chinese saying  
  
“快乐与分享，悲伤与分担。”——古老的中文谚语

_Verbal ventilation_ is the third process of grieving. It is the penultimate resolver of emotional flashbacks. Verbal ventilation is speaking or writing in a manner that airs out and releases painful feelings. When we let our words spring from what we feel, language is imbued with emotion, and pain can be released through what we say, think or write. As our grieving proficiency increases, we can verbally ventilate about our losses, using shame-dissolving language to tell the story of how we were unfairly deprived of our birthright to be welcomed into a family that cherished us.  
  
言语宣泄是哀悼的第三个过程。它是情感闪回的最后解决者。言语宣泄是以一种表达和释放痛苦情感的方式说话或写作。当我们让我们的言语从我们的感受中涌现出来时，语言就充满了情感，痛苦可以通过我们所说、所想或所写的内容得到释放。随着我们哀悼技巧的提高，我们可以用言语宣泄我们的损失，用消除羞耻的语言讲述我们如何不公平地被剥夺了进入一个珍惜我们的家庭的出生权的故事。

My favorite technique to enhance verbal ventilation is to encourage the survivor to talk in an uncensored manner about whatever comes to his mind while he focuses on his feelings. If his feelings are not in awareness, focusing on bodily sensations can provide rich grist for verbally venting.  
  
我最喜欢的增强言语宣泄的技术是鼓励幸存者以一种不受审查的方式谈论他在专注于自己的感受时脑海中出现的任何想法。如果他的感受没有意识到，关注身体感觉可以提供丰富的言语宣泄的素材。

Verbal Ventilation is therapeutic to the degree that a person’s words are colored by and descriptive of the anger, sadness, fear, shame and/or depression she feels. Ventilation that is liberally punctuated with actual crying or angering is especially powerful.  
  
言语宣泄在程度上具有治疗作用，因为一个人的言语被她所感受到的愤怒、悲伤、恐惧、羞耻和/或抑郁所染色和描述。带有实际哭泣或愤怒的宣泄尤其强大。
