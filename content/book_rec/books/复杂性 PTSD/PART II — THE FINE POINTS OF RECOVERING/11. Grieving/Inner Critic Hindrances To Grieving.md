\*\*Inner Critic Hindrances To Grieving

内心批评者对悲伤的阻碍\*\*

The greatest hindrance to effective grieving is typically the inner critic. When the critic is especially toxic, grieving may be counterproductive and contraindicated in early recovery. Those who were [[null|]]repeatedly pathologized and punished for emoting in childhood may experience grieving as exacerbating their flashbacks rather than relieving them.

最大的悲伤障碍通常是内心的批评家。当批评家特别有毒时，悲伤可能会适得其反，在早期康复期间可能是不适宜的。那些在童年时期因情绪表达而反复被病理化和惩罚的人可能会觉得悲伤加剧了他们的闪回，而不是缓解了它们。

I have worked with numerous survivors whose tears immediately triggered them into toxic shame. Their own potentially soothing tears elicited terrible self-attacks: “I’m so pathetic! No wonder nobody can stand me!” “God, I’m so unlovable when I snivel like this!” “I f\*ck up, and then make myself more of a loser by whining about it!” “What good is crying for yourself – it only makes you weaker!”

我与许多幸存者合作过，他们的眼泪立刻引发他们陷入有毒的羞愧。他们自己的可能舒缓的泪水却引发了可怕的自我攻击：“我真是太可悲了！难怪没有人能忍受我！”“上帝啊，我这样抽泣时，真是让人无法忍受！”“我搞砸了，然后还因为抱怨而让自己变得更糟糕！”“为自己哭泣有什么好处——它只会让你更弱！”

This latter response is particularly ironic, for once grieving is protected from the critic, nothing can restore a person’s inner strength and coping capacity like a good cry. I have defused active suicidality on dozens of occasions by simply eliciting the suffering person’s tears.

这种后一种回应尤其讽刺，因为一旦悲伤得到批评者的保护，没有什么能像一场痛哭一样恢复一个人的内在力量和应对能力。我通过仅仅引发痛苦之人的泪水，已经多次消除了主动自杀的念头。

Angering can also immediately trigger the survivor into toxic shame. This is often true of instances when there is only an angry thought or fantasy. Dysfunctional parents typically reserve their worst punishments for their child’s anger. This then traps the child’s anger inside.

愤怒也可能立即引发幸存者的有毒羞愧。这种情况通常发生在只有愤怒的想法或幻想时。功能失调的父母通常将最严厉的惩罚保留给孩子的愤怒。这然后使孩子的愤怒被压抑在内心。

Critic management is often the primary work of early stage grief work. This work involves recognizing and challenging the ways the critic is blocking or shaming the processes of grieving. As disidentification from the critic increases, grieving can then best be initiated with low intensity verbal ventilation. Over time verbal ventilation can be allowed to gradually increase in sad and angry intonation.

批评管理通常是早期哀悼工作的主要工作。这项工作包括识别和挑战批评者如何阻碍或羞辱哀悼过程。随着与批评者的去认同感增加，哀悼可以通过低强度的言语宣泄来最佳地启动。随着时间的推移，言语宣泄可以逐渐在悲伤和愤怒的语调中增加。

Once the critic has been sufficiently diminished and once thought-correction techniques have made the psyche more user-friendly, a person begins to tap into grief’s sweet relief-granting potential. He learns to grieve in a way that promotes and enhances [[null|]]compassion for the abandoned child he was and for the survivor he is today – still struggling in the throes of painful flashbacks.

一旦批评者被充分削弱，一旦思维纠正技术使心理更加友好，一个人就开始挖掘哀悼的甜蜜缓解潜力。他学会以一种促进和增强对他曾经是的孩子和他今天作为幸存者所感受到的痛苦的同情心的方式来哀悼——仍然在痛苦的闪回中挣扎。
