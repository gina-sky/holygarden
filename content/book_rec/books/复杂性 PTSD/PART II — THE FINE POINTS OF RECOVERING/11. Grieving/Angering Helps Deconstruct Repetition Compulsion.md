\*\*Angering Helps Deconstruct Repetition Compulsion

激怒有助于解构重复强迫症\*\*

Survivors need to resuscitate their instinctual anger about parental maltreatment or they risk blindly accepting others’ reenactments of these behaviors.

幸存者需要复苏他们对父母虐待的本能愤怒，否则他们可能会盲目接受他人对这些行为的重演。

A meek, visibly fearful client of mine suffered devastating sexual seductions by trusted male figures on three occasions in her adult life. Over time we traced these back to a childhood betrayal by a trusted uncle, the only seemingly kind caretaker of her childhood. She was emotionally abandoned by her parents, and he preyed upon her loneliness. He gradually took appropriate physical affection, one increment at a time, into contact that became increasingly sexual.

我的一个温顺、明显害怕的客户在其成年生活中三次遭受了令人痛心的性诱惑，这些诱惑来自她所信任的男性人物。随着时间的推移，我们追溯这些事件回到了她童年时期一个受信任的叔叔的背叛，他是她童年时期唯一看似善良的照顾者。她的父母在情感上遗弃了她，他利用了她的孤独。他逐渐将适当的身体接触，一次增加一点，变成了越来越具有性意味的接触。

My client was helpless with her uncle because her ability to say “no” was parentally extinguished by the time she was in pre-school. The ability to say “no” is the backbone of our instinct of self-protection. Consequently, she was unable to protest his sexual violations.

我的客户对她叔叔无助，因为在她上幼儿园的时候，她表达“不”的能力已经被父母扼杀了。说“不”是我们自我保护本能的支柱。因此，她无法抗议他的性侵犯。

On subsequent occasions in her life, a minister, a doctor and then a therapist exploited her via a reenactment of this original scenario. She was so lost in flashback all three times that she did not protest their exploitive betrayals. She could only react to the situations later by turning her anger inward, and blaming and shaming herself for not stopping it.

在她生活中的随后的几次事件中，一位牧师、一位医生然后是一位治疗师通过重现这一原始场景来利用她。她每次都如此沉浸在回忆中，以至于她没有抗议他们的剥削背叛。她只能事后通过将愤怒转向内心，责备和羞辱自己没有阻止这一切。

[[null|]]Eventually during our work together, she was able to engage in the angering process of grieving. After about six months of my witnessing and validating her anger at her various perpetrators, she came in one week glowing with pride. She welled with tears of joy and relief as she described her success in stopping an office predator who was in the early stages of a similar seduction.

最终，在我们共同工作的过程中，她能够参与到令人愤怒的悲伤过程中。大约六个月来，我见证并证实了她对各种施害者的愤怒，她在一周后带着骄傲的光芒回来。她喜极而泣，描述自己成功阻止了一个处于类似诱惑初期阶段的办公室猎食者。

This was the stage of seemingly friendly touching. But unwanted pats on the back gradually escalated into mild sexual innuendo, lingering touches on her hand and then her forearm. These were the first inappropriate advances that she had never been able to protest with her previous abusers. She was thrilled – in awe of herself – that she was able to say, in the presence of another worker no less: “Please don’t touch me. I don’t like it when you touch me, and I don’t want you to touch me anymore”. The seduction was immediately terminated.

这是看似友好的触摸阶段。但不受欢迎的拍背逐渐升级为轻微的性暗示，在她手上和前臂上的逗留。这些都是她以前从未能对前施暴者抗议的不当行为。她欣喜若狂——对自己感到敬畏——她能够在另一位工人的面前说：“请不要碰我。我不喜欢你碰我，我不想你再碰我了。”诱惑立即终止。
