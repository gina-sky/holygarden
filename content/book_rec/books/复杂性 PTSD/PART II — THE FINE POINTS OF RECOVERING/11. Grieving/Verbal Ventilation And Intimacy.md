**Verbal Ventilation And Intimacy  
  
言语宣泄与亲密**

Reciprocal verbal ventilation is the highway to intimacy in adult relationships. Sufficient practice with a safe enough other brings genuine experiences of comforting and restorative connection. For me and many of my clients, such experiences are more alleviating of loneliness than we had ever thought possible.  
  
相互言语通风是成人关系中亲密的捷径。与足够安全的人进行足够的练习，可以带来真正的安慰和恢复性的联系体验。对我来说和我的许多客户来说，这样的体验比我们曾经认为的可能更能缓解孤独感。

Nowhere is this truer than with mutual commiseration. _Mutual commiseration_ is the process in which two intimates are reciprocally sympathetic to each other’s troubles and difficulties. It is the deepest most intimate channel to intimacy – profounder than sex. Mutual commiseration also typically promotes a spontaneous opening into many levels of light-hearted and spontaneous connecting.  
  
在这方面，相互同情尤为如此。相互同情是指两个亲密的人相互同情对方的麻烦和困难。这是最深刻、最亲密的亲密渠道——比性更深刻。相互同情通常还会促进自发地进入许多轻松和自发的连接层次。

As deep and meaningful connection with another becomes more available and frequent, the survivor increasingly experiences the shrinking of his abandonment depression.  
  
随着与另一个人建立深入和有意义的关系变得更加容易和频繁，幸存者越来越感受到被遗弃的抑郁感在缩小。

[[null|]]I must reiterate here that some popular bodywork approaches to trauma belittle the usefulness of talk therapy. While somatic work is a vital tool of recovery, it alone cannot shrink your toxic critic or resuscitate your self-expression. Cognitive work, especially that which is empowered by verbal ventilation, is fundamental to Cptsd recovery.  
  
我必须在此重申，一些流行的身体工作方法轻视了谈话治疗的有用性。虽然身体工作是恢复的重要工具，但它单独并不能缩小你的有毒批评者或复苏你的自我表达。认知工作，尤其是那种通过言语宣泄获得力量的工作，对于 Cptsd 恢复是基本的。

With that said, we will move on to Feeling, the fourth grieving process – a process that is a type of body work. Feeling is a way of focusing on somatic experience that enables us to reclaim our ability to experience full, relaxed and vital inhabitancy of our bodies.  
  
话虽如此，我们将继续讨论第四个哀悼过程——感觉，这是一种身体工作。感觉是一种关注身体体验的方式，使我们能够重新获得体验我们身体完整、放松和充满活力的能力。
