\*\*Thinking And Feeling Simultaneously

同时思考和感受\*\*

When a survivor becomes proficient at verbal ventilation, she heals a crucial developmental arrest. She learns to think about feeling states in a way that creates healthy, helpful and appropriate responses to feelings. These responses are characteristically [[null|]]respectful to herself and to whomever she is with. In his book, _Emotional Intelligence,_ Daniel Goleman writes that this is a core trait of emotional intelligence.

当幸存者熟练掌握言语释放技巧时，她将克服关键的发展停滞。她学会以创造健康、有益和适当的情感反应的方式来思考情感状态。这些反应通常对自己和与她在一起的人都很尊重。在丹尼尔·戈尔曼的《情绪智力》一书中，他写道，这是情绪智力的核心特征。

With continued practice, verbal ventilation coordinates the left and right hemispheres of the brain so that whenever the right-brain is hyper-activated in flashback, the left-brain is also fully engaged \[this also can be seen in an MRI\]. With the left-brain back on line, the survivor can remember to use the flashback management steps to successfully help manage a flashback.

通过持续的练习，言语释放协调了大脑的左右半球，使得每当右脑在闪回中过度活跃时，左脑也能完全参与\[这也可以在 MRI 中看到\]。当左脑恢复在线状态时，幸存者可以记得使用闪回管理步骤来成功帮助管理闪回。

As with angering and crying, verbal ventilation is only effective when it is liberated from the critic’s control. In early recovery, verbal ventilation can easily shift into verbal self-flagellation. Verbally ventilating from the self-attacking or drasticizing perspective of the critic is rarely effective grieving. Instead it typically triggers or intensifies flashbacks, which in turn frequently generates self- and intimacy-injuring behavior.

与愤怒和哭泣一样，只有当言语宣泄摆脱了批评者的控制时，它才是有效的。在早期康复阶段，言语宣泄很容易转变为言语自我鞭挞。从批评者的自我攻击或极端化的角度进行言语宣泄很少是有效的哀悼。相反，这通常会引起或加剧闪回，进而频繁地产生自我和亲密关系伤害的行为。

Many survivors in early recovery are unable to notice their unconscious shifts into over-identifying with the critic’s point of view. When this is the case, they usually need the help of a therapist or sufficiently recovered intimate to help them recognize and neutralize the critic.

许多早期康复阶段的幸存者无法注意到他们无意识的转变，即过度认同批评者的观点。在这种情况下，他们通常需要治疗师或足够康复的亲密伴侣的帮助，以帮助他们识别和中和批评者。

Verbal Ventilation is an especially transformative grieving process. It not only promotes the same type of fear-release and shame-dissolution as angering and crying, but also helps to expose the manifold guises of the critic’s self-attack and fear-arousal programs. Verbal ventilation also helps us to identify and communicate about needs that have long been unmet because of our childhood abandonment.

言语宣泄是一种特别具有变革性的哀悼过程。它不仅促进了与愤怒和哭泣相同类型的恐惧释放和羞耻消除，还有助于揭露批评者自我攻击和恐惧唤起程序的多种伪装。言语宣泄还有助于我们识别和沟通因童年遗弃而长期未满足的需求。
