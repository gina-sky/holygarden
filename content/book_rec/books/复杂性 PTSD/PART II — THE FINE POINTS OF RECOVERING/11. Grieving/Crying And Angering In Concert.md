**Crying And Angering In Concert  
  
哭泣与愤怒的共鸣**

Crying and angering are the two key emotional tools for releasing the pain of the abandonment mélange. Typically we need both processes to attain full release.  
  
哭泣和愤怒是释放被遗弃混合痛苦的两个关键情感工具。通常，我们需要这两个过程才能达到完全释放。

Crying and angering together differs from whining. Whining is a type of emoting that gives grieving a bad name. Whining is a delicate subject because many people who complain and/or cry in a healthy manner are pathologized as “whiners.” Dysfunctional whining however is often an unhealthy mixture of angering and crying, where either the anger or sadness is repressed but leaks through in a grating manner.  
  
哭泣和愤怒的结合与抱怨不同。抱怨是一种给悲伤带来坏名声的情感表达方式。抱怨是一个微妙的话题，因为许多以健康方式抱怨和/或哭泣的人被病理化为“抱怨者”。然而，功能失调的抱怨通常是不健康的愤怒和哭泣的混合，其中愤怒或悲伤被压抑，但以一种刺耳的方式泄漏出来。

Here are two examples of this. When a hurt person only knows how to express anger, his repressed sadness unconsciously seeps [[null|]]into his anger in a way that makes him sound like a martyr or someone with delusions of persecution. Because there is no substantial release of his sadness, no amount of whining brings him relief, and he can angrily whine endlessly in a way that exhausts his listener’s empathy. Similarly when a hurt person is only able to cry, repressed anger tinges her sadness and makes it sound like irritable and interminable bellyaching. One of my clients calls this “anger coming through a very small hole.”  
  
这里有这个情况的两个例子。当一个受伤的人只知道如何表达愤怒时，他压抑的悲伤会不知不觉地渗透到他的愤怒中，使他听起来像是一个烈士或有人身受害妄想的人。因为他的悲伤没有实质性的释放，无论多少抱怨都无法带给他安慰，他可以愤怒地抱怨个不停，这种方式会耗尽听众的同情心。同样，当一个受伤的人只能哭泣时，压抑的愤怒会染上她的悲伤，使她的抱怨听起来像是烦躁且无休止的抱怨。我的一个客户称这为“愤怒从一个小洞中透出。”

Many of us suffer from a socialization process that relegates angering to men and crying to women. From an early age boys are shamed for crying while girls are treated similarly for angering. Hence boys become men who can only vent their emotional pain through angering. Sadness then must morph into an irritable mood, aggravated whining or angry catharsis. Similarly, some women unconsciously try to squeeze their anger out by whining or crying in a way that devolves into feeling stuck in helplessness and self-pity.  
  
许多人经历了将愤怒归咎于男性、将哭泣归咎于女性的社会化过程。从很小的时候起，男孩因为哭泣而受到羞辱，而女孩因为愤怒而受到类似的对待。因此，男孩成长为只能通过愤怒来发泄情感痛苦的男性。悲伤于是必须转变为易怒的情绪，加剧的抱怨或愤怒的宣泄。同样，一些女性不自觉地试图通过抱怨或哭泣来排解愤怒，这种方式最终会让人陷入无助和自怜的感觉。

Many men also rely on anger to carry all of their emotional expression. They get mad when they are scared, humiliated or feel down. Many women, on the other hand, can only try to cry out these feelings. This typically results in a very incomplete release. The full motion of emotion is arrested. Half of the normal emotional release process is then stymied in each gender.  
  
许多人也依赖愤怒来表达所有情绪。当他们害怕、受辱或感到沮丧时，就会发怒。另一方面，许多女性只能试图通过哭泣来表达这些感受。这通常导致非常不完整的释放。情绪的完整运动被阻止。在每种性别中，正常情绪释放过程的一半因此受阻。

Without complete emoting of his hurt, a survivor can become stuck in moodiness. His unexpressed emotion deteriorates into a stagnant and lingering mood. This moodiness can range from festering resentment to a shame-tainted self-pity that is anything but self-compassionate. Blocked anger can degenerate into bitter sullenness, and blocked sadness can deteriorate into melancholic self-indulgence.  
  
没有完全表达出他的伤痛，幸存者可能会陷入情绪化。他未表达的情绪会恶化成停滞和持续的忧郁。这种情绪化可能从怨恨的发酵到被羞愧玷污的自我怜悯，而后者根本不是自我同情。受阻的愤怒可能演变成苦涩的郁郁寡欢，受阻的悲伤可能恶化成忧郁的自我放纵。

How this contrasts with the healthy grieving of my six-year old son, who has to periodically grieve the loss of his narcissistic entitlement. Less and less does he get to be what Freud called: “His majesty the baby”.  
  
这与我的六岁儿子健康地哀悼他自恋性特权丧失的方式形成鲜明对比。他越来越少能成为弗洛伊德所说的：“他的宝宝陛下”。

[[null|]]As his previously apt entitlement lessens, he mildly bawls at new rules that are age-appropriate for him to learn. Bawling is the evolution of the baby’s angry cry, and it releases pain through angry crying. He howled a bit this afternoon about the “unfairness” of having to do his homework after school before he could play some more.  
  
随着他之前恰当的特权减少，他轻微地嚎啕大哭，因为新规则对他来说是适合学习的年龄。嚎啕大哭是婴儿愤怒哭声的进化，它通过愤怒的哭泣来释放痛苦。今天下午，他因为不得不在学校作业后才能再玩一会儿而抱怨“不公平”。

As we climbed the 37 stairs to our home, he punctuated his crying with a flurry of angry condemnations: “I don’t like you daddy. You’re not fair. I’m not going to be your friend”. I am grateful for this healthy grieving, and still somewhat amazed that I can so calmly “hold” it as I help him metabolize this latest loss of early childhood narcissistic privilege.  
  
当我们爬上 37 级楼梯回到家时，他用一阵愤怒的谴责来打断他的哭泣：“我不喜欢你爸爸。你不公平。我不会再和你做朋友。”我对这种健康的悲伤感到感激，并且仍然有些惊讶，我能够如此平静地“承受”它，同时帮助他消化这个早期童年自恋特权的最新损失。

By the time we get to the top of the stairs he opens the door and genuinely peals out a guileless laugh: “Daddy, look! Picachu fell off the table. Daddy can we play Pokémon after I practice writing my letters?”  
  
当我们到达楼梯顶端时，他打开门，真诚地爆发出天真无邪的笑声：“爸爸，看！皮卡丘从桌子上掉下来了。爸爸，我练习写字母后我们能玩宝可梦吗？”

Grieving has almost instantly delivered him from painful loss into eager apprehension of what is fun about life and what there is to look forward to. How frequently, I see my clients reemerge into remembering their real, present-day resourcefulness once they have grieved through a painful flashback.  
  
悲伤几乎瞬间将他从痛苦的失落中带入了急切地期待生活中有趣的事物以及值得期待的事物。我经常看到我的客户在经历了痛苦的回忆之后，重新记起他们真实的、当下的机智。

When we can both anger and cry while re-experiencing our early abandonment in a flashback, we can obtain a more complete release from the abandonment mélange. Each survivor does well to assess whether his angering or crying is blocked or stultified, and to then work at recovering it.  
  
当我们能够在回忆早期被遗弃的经历时既愤怒又哭泣，我们就能从遗弃的混合情绪中获得更完整的释放。每个幸存者都应该评估自己的愤怒或哭泣是否被阻碍或抑制，然后努力恢复它。

There are of course numerous men and women who are reverse examples of the gender polarization mentioned above. Moreover, there are many survivors in whom both angering and crying are blocked. They also benefit inordinately from rescuing the healing balm of both anger and tears from the stultifying prohibitions of the critic.  
  
当然，有许多男性和女性是上述性别极化的反面例子。此外，还有许多幸存者既愤怒又哭泣都被阻碍。他们同样可以从批评者的抑制性禁令中拯救出愤怒和眼泪的治愈良药，从中受益匪浅。

[[null|]]If you are unable cry or feel angry, focusing on your breath may help you to emote. This is especially true if you attend to the sensations in your abdominal region as it expands and contracts during respiration. Deep, slow and rhythmic breathing stretches and expands various visceral muscles and internal organs in ways that sometimes bring feelings into awareness.  
  
如果你无法哭泣或感到愤怒，专注于你的呼吸可能有助于你表达情感。这尤其适用于你在呼吸时关注腹部区域的膨胀和收缩所感受到的触觉。深、慢、有节奏的呼吸以某种方式拉伸和扩张各种内脏肌肉和内部器官，有时这会将感觉带入意识。

If this does not help, Holotropic Rebirthing and Reichian therapy employ special breathing techniques to help free stuck emotions. I know many survivors who first reclaimed their capacity to emote through these techniques.  
  
如果这没有帮助，霍洛托普再生和赖希疗法采用特殊的呼吸技巧来帮助释放停滞的情感。我知道许多幸存者最初是通过这些技巧重新获得表达情感的能力的。
