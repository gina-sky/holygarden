\*\*GRIEVING AMELIORATES FLASHBACKS

哀悼改善闪回\*\*

“Pain is excess energy crying out for release.” – Gerald Heard

“痛苦是过剩的能量在呼喊释放。”——杰拉尔德·赫德

Grieving sometimes seems sacramental to me in its ability to move me out of the abandonment mélange, that extremely painful and upsetting amalgam of fear, shame and depression that is at the emotional core of most flashbacks.

对我来说，哀悼有时似乎具有神圣的意义，它能够帮助我摆脱被遗弃的混合体，那种极度痛苦和令人不安的恐惧、羞愧和抑郁的混合体，这是大多数闪回的情感核心。

A survivor can learn to grieve himself out of fear - the death of feeling safe. He can learn to grieve himself out of shame - the death of feeling worthy. He can learn to grieve himself out of depression - the death of feeling fully alive.

一个幸存者可以学会通过悲伤来克服恐惧——安全感的丧失。他可以学会通过悲伤来克服羞愧——值得感的丧失。他可以学会通过悲伤来克服抑郁——完全活着的感的丧失。

With sufficient grieving, the survivor gets that he was innocent and eminently loveable as a child. As he mourns the bad luck of not being born to loving parents, he finds within himself a fierce, unshakeable self-allegiance. He becomes ready, willing and able to be there for himself no matter what he is experiencing - internally or externally.

在足够的悲伤之后，幸存者会意识到自己作为一个孩子是无辜的，非常可爱。当他哀悼自己没有出生在爱人的父母身边的不幸时，他会在自己内心找到一种激烈、坚定不移的自我忠诚。他变得准备好、愿意并且能够无论经历什么——无论是内部还是外部——都为自己存在。

Griefwork also releases you from the impatience and frustration that can arise when you get re-stuck in an inner critic attack. This is especially important during those “monster” flashbacks when the critic can bully you into wanting to give up. At such times, angering and crying at this terrible intrusion from your past can rescue you from forgetting how far you have come and how much safer you are now.

悲伤工作还能让你摆脱当你在内心批评攻击中再次陷入困境时可能产生的急躁和挫败感。这在那些“怪物”闪回时尤为重要，当批评者可能会逼迫你想要放弃。在这样的时刻，对这种可怕过去的入侵感到愤怒和哭泣可以让你从忘记自己已经走了多远以及现在有多安全中拯救出来。
