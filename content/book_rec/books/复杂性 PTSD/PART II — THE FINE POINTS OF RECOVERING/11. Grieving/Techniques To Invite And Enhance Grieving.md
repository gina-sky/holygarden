\*\*Techniques To Invite And Enhance Grieving

邀请和增强哀悼的技术\*\*

Tears were hard to come by after my first breakthrough cry in early adulthood. I would often long for the incredible relief I felt on that occasion, but unlike angering, I could not force my crying. I have come to learn that this is typical of many people. My friend Malcolm, suffering the same frustration, wanted to cry so badly, that he squeezed lemon juice into his eyes. He was able to laugh about it later, but solemnly warned me to never try such a thing.

在我成年初期第一次突破性的哭泣之后，泪水变得很难流出。我经常渴望那种场合下我感受到的难以置信的解脱，但与愤怒不同，我无法强迫自己哭泣。我渐渐了解到，这种情况对很多人来说很典型。我的朋友马尔科姆，同样遭受着同样的挫败，非常想哭，以至于他把柠檬汁挤进了眼睛。他后来能笑出声来，但严肃地警告我永远不要尝试这样的事情。

This is a list that evolved out of our ongoing discussions about how to coax out the tears of a good cry. As with all the advice in this book, please feel free to use only the ones that seem to fit, and in whatever order seems best. Moreover, different combinations may enhance either crying or angering, or both together. Finally, [[null|]]sometimes nothing works, but I encourage you to try techniques that intuitively seem like they may work more than once.

这是一份从我们关于如何引导出有效哭泣的持续讨论中演变而来的清单。与本书中的所有建议一样，请随意使用那些看起来适合您的建议，并按照您认为最好的顺序进行。此外，不同的组合可能会增强哭泣或愤怒，或者两者兼而有之。最后，有时什么方法都不起作用，但我鼓励您多次尝试那些直觉上似乎可能有效的方法。

1.  Find a safe and comfortable place where you won’t be heard.
    找一个安全舒适的地方，在那里您不会被听到。
2.  Close your eyes and remember a time when you felt compassionate towards someone. This can be from real life, or from reading a book or a poem, or from watching a movie or moving news item.
    闭上眼睛，回忆起您曾对某人产生同情的时候。这可以来自现实生活中，或来自阅读一本书或一首诗，或观看一部电影或感人的新闻。
3.  Invoke self-compassion via the memory of someone who was kind to you, or imagine someone you think would be kind to you. I would be kind to you.
    通过回忆一个曾经对您友善的人来唤起自我同情，或者想象一个您认为会善待您的人。我会善待您。
4.  Verbally ventilate about what is bothering you in a journal or aloud to a real or imagined friend or to me.
    用日记或大声向一个真实或想象中的朋友或向我倾诉你心中的烦恼。
5.  Imagine yourself being comforted by a Higher Power. See yourself in the lap of a kind higher power or actual person who seems kind. \[Santa Claus once worked well for one of my clients\].
    想象自己被一位更高的力量所安慰。想象自己在一个善良的更高力量或看似善良的人的怀里。\[圣诞老人曾有效帮助过我的一个客户\]。
6.  Remember a time when you felt better from crying or angering, or seeing someone else cry in real life or in a movie.
    回忆一下，当你哭泣或愤怒时，或者看到别人在现实生活中或在电影中哭泣时，你感觉好一些的时刻。

9.  Imagine your tears or anger carrying any fear, shame or depression up and out of you.
    想象你的泪水或愤怒带着任何恐惧、羞愧或抑郁从你体内升起并排出。
10. Imagine holding your inner child compassionately. Tell the child it’s normal and okay to feel sad or mad about feeling bad or hurt.  



    想象你以同情心拥抱你的内在小孩。告诉这个孩子，感到悲伤或愤怒是正常的，因为感到不好或受伤。

11. Tell the child you’ll protect him/her from being criticized.

15. Watch a movie that portrays “enviable” anger release.

[[null|]]An elaborating note on technique #15: Several clients told me that the scene in the 1976 movie _Network_ where the main character yells out a window: “We’re not taking it anymore”, helped them to bring up and ventilate their anger.

关于技术#15 的详细说明：几位客户告诉我，1976 年电影《网络》中，主角从窗户大声喊出“我们再也不能忍受了”，这帮助他们表达和宣泄自己的愤怒。

Finally, if reading this book does not begin to release the critic’s stranglehold on your ability to grieve, please consider working with a therapist or support group to help you work through the shame that the critic uses to spoil your ability to grieve.

最后，如果阅读这本书没有开始帮助你摆脱批评家对你哀悼能力的束缚，请考虑与治疗师或支持小组合作，帮助你克服批评家用来破坏你哀悼能力的羞耻感。
