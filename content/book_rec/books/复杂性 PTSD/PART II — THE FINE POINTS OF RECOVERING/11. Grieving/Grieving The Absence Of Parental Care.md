**Grieving The Absence Of Parental Care  
  
哀悼父母关爱的缺失**

As our capacity to grieve evolves, we typically uncover a great deal of unresolved grief about the deadening absence of the nurturance [[null|]]we needed to develop and thrive. Here are the key types of parental nurturing that all children need in order to flourish. Knowing about these unmet needs can help you to grieve out the unreleased pain that comes from having grown up without this type of support. Moreover, this knowledge can guide you to reparent and interact with yourself more nurturingly.  
  
随着我们哀悼能力的发展，我们通常会发现许多关于我们发展壮大所需的滋养缺失的未解决哀伤。以下是所有孩子为了茁壮成长所需的关键类型的父母滋养。了解这些未满足的需求可以帮助你哀悼因没有这种支持而成长起来的未释放的痛苦。此外，这种知识可以指导你以更滋养的方式自我养育和互动。

[[null|]]My book, _The Tao of Fully Feeling,_ contains extensive guidelines and encouragements for identifying and grieving the losses of childhood. Sandra Bloom’s article: “The Grief That Dare Not Speak Its Name, Part II, Dealing with The Ravages of Childhood” also identifies childhood losses from trauma in a very specific and compelling way. \[Please see [www.sanctuaryweb.com](http://www.sanctuaryweb.com)\].  
  
我的书《全然感受的道》包含了大量关于识别和哀悼童年损失的指南和鼓励。Sandra Bloom 的文章《不敢言说的悲伤，第二部分：处理童年的破坏》也以非常具体和引人入胜的方式识别了童年创伤中的损失。\[请参阅 www.sanctuaryweb.com\]。

It is often difficult to become motivated to grieve losses that occurred so long ago. Many of these losses seem so nebulous that trying to embrace grieving is a bit like trying to embrace dental work. Who wants to go to the dentist? But who doesn’t go once the toothache becomes acute?  
  
常常难以激发对很久以前发生的损失的悲伤情绪。许多这些损失看起来如此模糊，试图接受悲伤就像试图拥抱牙科治疗一样。谁愿意去看牙医？但一旦牙痛变得剧烈，谁又不想去看牙医呢？

Soul ache is considerably harder to assign to the losses of childhood, yet those who take the grieving journey described below come to know unquestionably that the core of their soul ache and psychological suffering is in the unworked through losses of growing up with abandoning parents.  
  
灵魂的痛苦要难得多，无法归咎于童年的损失，然而那些经历了下面描述的悲伤之旅的人，无疑会知道他们灵魂的痛苦和心理上的痛苦的核心在于成长过程中与抛弃他们的父母未得到处理的损失。

These losses have to be grieved until the person really gets how much her caretakers were not caretakers, and how much her parents were not her allies. She needs to grieve until she stops blaming herself for their abuse and/or neglect. She needs to grieve until she fully realizes that their abysmal parenting practices gave her that awful gift that keeps on giving: Cptsd. She needs to grieve until she understands how her learned habit of automatic self-abandonment is a reenactment of their abject failure to be there for her.  
  
这些损失必须得到哀悼，直到这个人真正明白她的照顾者并非照顾者，她的父母并非她的盟友。她需要哀悼，直到她不再因为他们的虐待和/或忽视而责怪自己。她需要哀悼，直到她完全意识到他们糟糕的育儿方式给了她一个持续不断的礼物：创伤后应激障碍。她需要哀悼，直到她理解她习得的自动自我放弃的习惯是对他们无法在她身边时的彻底失败的重复。

Mourning these awful realities empowers our efforts to develop a multidimensional practice of self-care. As we grieve more effectively, our capacities for self-compassion and self-protection grow, and our psyche becomes increasingly user friendly.  
  
哀悼这些可怕的现实，赋予我们发展多维自我关怀实践的努力。随着我们更有效地哀悼，我们的自我同情和自我保护能力增强，我们的心理状态变得越来越易于使用。
