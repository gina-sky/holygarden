**Feeling Can Heal Digestive Problems  
  
感受可以治愈消化问题**

The practice of feeling is also similar to healthy food digestion whereby a relaxed digestive tract allows us to effectively assimilate nutrients. If, however, we suppress or repress our feelings, our bodies typically armor and tighten, especially along the alimentary canal.  
  
感受的实践也与健康的食物消化相似，其中放松的消化系统使我们能够有效地吸收营养。然而，如果我们压抑或抑制我们的感受，我们的身体通常会变得装甲和紧绷，尤其是在消化道沿线。

I believe digestive tract-tightening can create the types of digestive problems that frequently co-occur with Cptsd. Diarrhea, for instance, is sometimes an emotionally-caused, physical response to intense danger. When this occurs, fear triggers the sympathetic nervous system into further triggering an immediate evacuation of the bowels. Nausea can operate similarly. Constipation, on the other hand, is sometimes a tightening in the alimentary canal that hampers the peristaltic motion necessary for healthy evacuation.  
  
我相信肠道紧缩可以导致与 PTSD 经常并发的消化问题。例如，腹泻有时是情绪引起的对强烈危险的生理反应。当这种情况发生时，恐惧会触发交感神经系统，进一步引发肠道立即排空。恶心也可以以类似的方式发生。另一方面，便秘有时是肠道紧缩，阻碍了健康排空所需的蠕动运动。
