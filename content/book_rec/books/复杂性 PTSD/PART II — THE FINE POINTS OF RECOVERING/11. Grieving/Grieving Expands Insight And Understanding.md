\_“It tastes sweet doesn’t it?”

“这味道不甜吗？”\_

\_“You have caught me”, grief answered,

“你抓住了我”，悲伤回答道：\_

\_“And you’ve ruined my business

_How can I sell sorrow, when you know its blessing?”_ -RUMI

当你知道它的祝福时，我如何去卖悲伤？” —— 路米

Insight, as crucially important as it is, is never enough to attain the deeper levels of recovering. No amount of intention or epiphany can bypass a survivor’s need to learn to lovingly care for himself when he is in an emotional flashback. It is crucial that we respond to ourselves with kindness when we are feeling scared, sad, mad, or bad.

洞察力，尽管它至关重要，但永远不足以达到恢复的更深层次。无论多少意图或顿悟都无法绕过幸存者学会在情绪闪回时温柔地照顾自己的需求。当我们感到害怕、悲伤、愤怒或糟糕时，以善意回应自己是至关重要的。

Grieving aids the survivor immeasurably to work through the death-like experience of being lost and trapped in an emotional flashback. Grieving metabolizes our most painful abandonment feelings, especially those that give rise to suicidal ideation, and at their worst, active suicidality.

哀悼极大地帮助幸存者处理在情绪闪回中迷失和被困的类似死亡的经历。哀悼代谢了我们最痛苦的被遗弃感，尤其是那些引发自杀想法，在最糟糕的情况下，导致自杀行为的感觉。”

Recoverees also need to grieve the death of their early attachment needs. We must grieve the awful fact that safety and belonging was scarce or non-existent in our own families. We need to mourn the myriad heartbreaks of our frustrated attempts to win approval and affection from our parents.

康复者还需要哀悼他们早期依恋需求的丧失。我们必须哀悼这样一个可怕的事实：在我们的家庭中，安全和归属感是稀缺的，甚至不存在。我们需要哀悼我们无数次试图赢得父母认可和爱护而失败的种种心碎。

Grieving also supports recovery from the many painful, deathlike losses caused by childhood traumatization. Key childhood losses - addressed throughout this book - are all the crucial developmental arrests that we suffered. The most essential of these are the deaths of our self-compassion and our self-esteem, as well as our abilities to protect ourselves and fully express ourselves.

哀悼也支持从童年创伤造成的许多痛苦、类似死亡般的损失中恢复。本书中提到的关键童年损失——我们遭受的所有关键发展停滞——都是如此。其中最重要的是我们自我同情和自尊的丧失，以及我们保护自己和充分表达自己的能力。
