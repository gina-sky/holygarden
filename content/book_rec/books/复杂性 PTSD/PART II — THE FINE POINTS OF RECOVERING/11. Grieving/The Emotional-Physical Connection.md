\*\*The Emotional-Physical Connection

情绪-身体联系\*\*

There is often a close relationship between emotion and physical sensation. Physical sensations in the body often co-occur with feelings. Moreover, sensations of tightness and tension can develop as a defense against feelings. As unexpressed feelings accumulate, a greater degree of muscular tension is necessary to keep them under wraps.

情绪和身体感觉之间往往存在密切的关系。身体感觉经常与情感同时出现。此外，紧绷和紧张的感觉可以作为一种防御机制来对抗情感。随着未表达的情感积累，需要更大的肌肉紧张度来抑制它们。

一个反复因表达情感而受到惩罚的孩子会学会害怕内心的情感体验，并努力通过紧绷身体的肌肉来抑制情感，并将它们从意识中排除。

Holding your breath is a further manifestation of armoring. It is an especially common way of keeping feelings at bay, as breathing naturally brings your awareness down to the level of feeling.

屏住呼吸是防御机制的一种表现。这是一种特别常见的避免感受的方式，因为自然呼吸会将你的意识降低到感受的水平。

As my client, Kylie, free associated on the feelings of a particularly intense flashback, she painfully recalled the traumas she underwent trying to avoid her mother’s punishments for crying. Her worst memory was of the day in the supermarket, when her mother’s scolding rained down upon her as she tried to suppress her rapidly mounting urge to cry. Knowing the worst punishment would ensue if she cried, she held her breath to hold back the tears. She held it so long that she fainted from lack of oxygen and cracked her head open on the floor. Her mother, mortified by what she saw as public humiliation, beat her black and blue when she got home.

作为我的客户，凯莉在自由联想中回忆起一段特别强烈的闪回感受时，痛苦地回忆起她为了逃避母亲因哭泣而施加的惩罚所经历的创伤。她最糟糕的记忆是在超市的那一天，当她试图抑制越来越强烈的哭泣冲动时，母亲的责骂如雨点般落下。她知道如果哭泣，将会遭受最严厉的惩罚，于是她屏住呼吸以抑制眼泪。她屏住呼吸的时间太长，以至于因缺氧而晕倒，头部重重地撞在地板上，头骨开裂。当她回到家时，母亲因为看到她认为的公众羞辱而将她打得青一块紫一块。

It took us two years of trust-building work to bring this incident back into awareness. She then cried her first tears since when it happened, three decades earlier. These were also the first tears she could ever remember that brought relief.

我们花了两年时间建立信任，才将这一事件重新带入她的意识。然后，她流下了自三十年前发生那件事以来的第一滴泪。这些也是她能记得的第一次带来缓解的泪水。

The technique of focusing your awareness on physical sensations in your body can help you to become more proficient at the practice of “feeling”. With enough practice, paying attention to tightness in your face, throat, heart or belly area brings feelings into awareness, where they can simply be _felt through_. However, in your early experiences of focusing on sensations, feelings may come up so strongly that you will benefit from allowing yourself to emote them.

将你的意识集中在身体中的物理感觉上，可以帮助你更熟练地练习“感受”。经过足够的练习，关注脸部、喉咙、心脏或腹部区域的紧张感，可以让感觉进入意识，从而简单地感受它们。然而，在你刚开始关注感觉时，感觉可能会如此强烈，让你受益于允许自己表达这些情绪。
