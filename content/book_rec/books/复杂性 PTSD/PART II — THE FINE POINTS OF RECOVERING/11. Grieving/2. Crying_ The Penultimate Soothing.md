**2\. Crying: The Penultimate Soothing  
  
2\. 哭泣：最后的慰藉**

In grieving, crying is the yin complementary process to the yang process of angering. When we are hurt, we instinctively feel sad as well as mad. The newborn child, hurt by the loss of the perfect security of the womb, howls an angry cry.  
  
在悲伤中，哭泣是愤怒阳性的互补过程。当我们受到伤害时，我们本能地感到悲伤和愤怒。新生儿的完美子宫安全感的丧失，会发出愤怒的哭声。

Crying is also an irreplaceable tool for cutting off the critic’s emotional fuel supply. Tears can release fear before it devolves into frightened and frightening thinking. In fact, crying is sometimes the only process that will resolve a flashback. I have witnessed my own critic wither into innocuousness hundreds of times after a good cry. On thousands of other occasions, I have seen my clients dissolve their fear, shame and self-abandonment with the solvent of their tears. I have also seen them then surface into a healthily angry place, determined to confront a current unfairness that they now find unacceptable.  
  
哭泣也是切断批评者情感燃料供应的不可替代的工具。泪水可以在恐惧演变成恐惧和令人恐惧的思维之前释放出来。事实上，哭泣有时是解决闪回的唯一过程。我在一次好的哭泣后，看到我的批评者数百次枯萎成无害的状态。在数千次其他场合，我看到我的客户用他们的泪水溶解了他们的恐惧、羞愧和自我放弃。我也看到他们随后浮出水面，进入一个健康愤怒的地方，决心面对他们现在认为无法接受的当前不公平。

[[null|]]A client who left a year-long therapy to move elsewhere recently wrote to me about an experience that she had with crying. She was hospitalized with terrible stomach pain and soon learned that she had cancer. She had wisely cut off contact with a toxic family, but was all alone in her new living situation. She was beside herself with fear, and felt like she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She wrote: “I know you think that all that talking you did to me about crying didn’t get through. So did I in fact, but at the moment I was feeling the most hopeless, some of your words came back to me, and a rainstorm of tears fell out of me. It scared me at first, but I soon started feeling this amazing sense of relief, and that I would be OK if I let them operate on me. It’s now twelve months since then and many tears later \[not to mention a bit of barking at God\] and I seem to be well and truly in the clear.”  
  
一位离开了一年的治疗并搬去其他地方的客户最近给我写信，讲述了她与哭泣的经历。她因严重的胃痛住院，不久后得知自己患有癌症。她明智地断绝了与一个有毒家庭的联系，但在新的生活环境中却孤独一人。她恐惧万分，感觉自己即将崩溃。她写道：“我知道你认为你之前和我谈论哭泣的那些话都没有起到作用。事实上，我也这么认为，但在我最绝望的时候，你的一些话回到了我的脑海中，泪水如暴风雨般涌出。一开始我感到害怕，但很快我开始感到一种奇妙的感觉，如果我让他们为我做手术，我会没事的。从那时起已经过去十二个月了，泪水也流了很多\[更不用说偶尔对上帝抱怨几句\]现在我觉得自己真的已经康复了。”

Here is another testimony to the power of tears. It is excerpted from an e-mail of a male client who wrote to me six months after we finished a year long course of therapy. “I think it’s the tears..... crying so much of late.....you were right! It’s great; I love it, tears of sadness, tears at the beauty in the world, tears of grief and loss, and tears of gratitude that my life is finally becoming manageable and even intimate. I’ve cried more in the past couple of months than I have done the past couple of decades. I am actually opening up to life, it’s become less narrow, it’s not just pain, shame, guilt.....there’s something else, something quite beautiful.”  
  
这里又是泪水力量的另一个证明。这是从一位男性客户在完成一年期治疗六个月后给我的一封电子邮件中摘录的：“我想是泪水……最近哭得很多……你是对的！这很好；我喜欢它，悲伤的泪水，世界美好的泪水，悲伤和失去的泪水，以及感激的泪水，因为我的生活终于变得可以管理，甚至亲密。在过去的几个月里，我哭得比过去几十年都多。我实际上正在向生活敞开心扉，它变得不那么狭隘了，不只是痛苦、羞愧、内疚……还有其他东西，非常美丽的东西。”

An additional benefit of crying is that unabashed tears stimulate the relaxation response of the parasympathetic nervous system. This counterbalances the excessive sympathetic nervous system hyperarousal we experience in a flashback.  
  
哭泣的另一个好处是，毫不掩饰的泪水刺激了副交感神经系统的放松反应。这抵消了我们经历闪回时过度交感神经系统的过度激活。

As we learn to grieve effectively, we allow ourselves to mourn about the lack of positive parental attention in our childhoods. We [[null|]]feel sorrow about the horrible reality that parental attention was typically negative and dangerous. As recovering progresses, we also cry for the child who not appreciated and reflected as special, worthy, and easy to love.  
  
随着我们学会有效地哀悼，我们让自己为童年时缺乏积极的父母关注而哀悼。我们为父母关注通常消极且危险的现实感到悲伤。随着恢复的进展，我们也为那个没有得到欣赏和被视为特别、值得爱和容易相爱的孩子而哭泣。
