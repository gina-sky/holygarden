**1\. Angering: Diminishes Fear and Shame  
  
1\. 愤怒：减少恐惧和羞愧**

_Angering_ is the grieving technique of aggressively complaining about current or past losses and injustices. Survivors need to anger - sometimes rage - about the intimidation, humiliation and neglect that was passed off to them as nurturance in their childhoods. As they become adept at grieving, they anger out their healthy resentment at their family’s pervasive lack of safety. They become incensed about the ten thousand betrayals of never being helped in times of need. They feel rage that there was never anyone to go to for guidance or protection. They bellow that there was no one to appeal to for fairness or appreciative recognition of their developmental achievements.  
  
愤怒是积极抱怨当前或过去损失和不公正的悲伤技巧。幸存者需要愤怒——有时是愤怒——关于那些被当作童年养育的恐吓、羞辱和忽视。随着他们变得擅长悲伤，他们会将对家庭普遍缺乏安全的健康怨恨发泄出来。他们对在需要帮助时从未得到帮助的成千上万次背叛感到愤怒。他们感到愤怒，因为没有人在需要指导和保护时可以求助。他们咆哮，没有人可以向其申诉公平或对其发展成就表示赞赏的认可。

My first book, _The Tao of Fully Feeling, Harvesting Forgiveness Out Of Blame,_ explicates in great detail a safe process for angering [[null|]]out childhood pain in a way that does not hurt the survivor or anyone else. In most cases, survivors do not have to directly anger at and blame their living parents. The key place to direct it is at your internalized parents - the parents of your past. The most common exception to this occurs when a parent is still abusive. This and other exceptions are explored in depth in my first book.  
  
我的第一本书，《全然感受的道》，从责备中收获宽恕，详细阐述了在不会伤害幸存者或任何他人的情况下，愤怒地释放童年痛苦的安全过程。在大多数情况下，幸存者不必直接对活着的父母愤怒和责备。关键的地方是将其指向你内化的父母——你过去的父母。最常见的例外是当父母仍然施虐时。这本书深入探讨了这一和其他例外。

Angering is therapeutic when the survivor rails against childhood trauma, and especially when he rails against its living continuance in the self-hate processes of the critic. Angrily saying “No!” or “Shut Up!” to the critic, the deputy of his parents, externalizes his anger. It stops him from turning this anger against himself, and allows him to revive the lost instinct of defending himself against unjust attack.  
  
当幸存者对童年创伤感到愤怒，尤其是当他反对批评者身上的这种活着的延续——自我仇恨的过程时，愤怒是有益的。愤怒地对批评者说“不！”或“闭嘴！”将他的愤怒外化。这阻止了他将这种愤怒转向自己，并使他能够恢复失去的自我防御本能。

Additionally, angering rescues the survivor from toxic shame. It rescues him from blindly letting his parents’ venomous blame turn into shame. Angering redirects blame back to where it belongs. It also augments his motivation to keep fighting to establish internal boundaries against the critic.  
  
此外，愤怒可以拯救幸存者免受有毒的羞耻感。它使他免于盲目地让父母的毒液般的责备变成羞耻。愤怒将责备重新引回它应该归属的地方。它还增强了他的动力，继续战斗，建立对抗批评者的内部界限。

Angering can be done alone or in the presence of a validating witness, such as a trusted friend or therapist. Over time the vast majority of angering needs to be done silently in the privacy of your own psyche. This is the anger-empowered thought-stopping of shielding yourself from inner critic attacks.  
  
愤怒可以单独进行，也可以在有验证见证者的在场下进行，比如一个信任的朋友或治疗师。随着时间的推移，绝大多数的愤怒需要在你自己的心理隐私中默默地完成。这是通过保护自己免受内心批评者的攻击来停止愤怒的思考。

Many survivors are so identified with the critic that it becomes their whole identity. Such survivors typically need to focus on fighting off the critic until they have established the healthy ego function of self-protection.  
  
许多幸存者与批评者如此认同，以至于这成为了他们的全部身份。这样的幸存者通常需要专注于抵制批评者，直到他们建立了健康的自我保护的自尊功能。

Angering also serves to rescue a person from the childlike sense of powerlessness that she is flashing back to. It reminds her that she inhabits an adult body with which she can now defend herself.  
  
愤怒还帮助一个人从她回想起的无助的儿童感中解脱出来。它提醒她，她现在居住在一个成人的身体里，她可以用这个身体来保护自己。

Through all these functions, angering serves to reduce or antidote fear. It reawakens and nurtures the instinct of self-preservation. With practice it increasingly builds a sense of both outer and [[null|]]inner boundaries. These boundaries increasingly move us out of harm’s way. They offer safety from the bullying of others, and safety from the most damaging bully of all – the inner critic.  
  
通过所有这些功能，愤怒的作用是减少或对抗恐惧。它重新唤醒并培养自我保护的直觉。通过实践，它越来越多地建立外在和内在的界限。这些界限越来越多地将我们带离危险。它们为我们提供了免受他人欺凌的安全，以及免受所有最具破坏性的欺凌者——内心批评者的安全。

Finally, angering can also empower the myriad thought corrections and substitutions needed to establish the survivor’s belief in her own essential goodness and in the lovability of discriminately chosen others. Angering bolsters her for the long-term, gradual process of wrestling her self-image away from the critic and reeducating the psyche to make it both user- and intimacy-friendly.  
  
最后，愤怒还可以激发出建立幸存者对自己本质善良的信念以及选择他人可爱性的无数思想修正和替代。愤怒为她提供了长期、逐步的过程，以摆脱批评者的自我形象，并重新教育心理，使其既适合用户也适合亲密关系。
