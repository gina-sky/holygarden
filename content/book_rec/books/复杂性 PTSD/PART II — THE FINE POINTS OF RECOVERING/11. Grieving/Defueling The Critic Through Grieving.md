\*\*Defueling The Critic Through Grieving

通过哀悼来削弱批评者\*\*

Fear drives the toxic inner critic. The critic feeds off fear and flashes the survivor back to the frightening times of childhood. She gets stuck seeing herself only through her parents’ contemptuous, intimidating or rejecting eyes. She then imitates them and scornfully mocks herself as “defective”, “ugly”, “unlovable”. She scares herself with endangerment scenarios and abhors herself for insignificant imperfections.

恐惧驱使着有毒的内心批评家。批评家以恐惧为食，并将幸存者带回到童年时的可怕时光。她陷入只通过父母轻蔑、威胁或拒绝的眼神看待自己的困境。然后她模仿他们，轻蔑地嘲笑自己为“有缺陷的”、“丑陋的”、“不可爱的”。她用危险情景吓唬自己，并因微不足道的瑕疵而厌恶自己。

Because fear is a core emotional experience, emotional tools are needed to manage the fright that runs haywire during a flashback. Healthy angering and crying can short-circuit fear from morphing into the flashback-triggering cognitions of the critic. I have seen grieving bring the critic’s devastating programs of drasticizing and catastrophizing to a screeching halt on thousands of occasions.

因为恐惧是一种核心的情感体验，需要情感工具来管理在闪回时失控的恐惧。健康的愤怒和哭泣可以阻止恐惧转变为批评者引发的闪回认知。我见过无数次，悲伤使批评者的极端化和灾难化程序戛然而止。

It appears that children are hard-wired to release fear through angering and crying. The newborn baby, mourning the death of living safely and fully contained inside the mother, utters the first of many angry cries not only to call for nurturance and attention, but also to release her fear.

孩子似乎天生就会通过愤怒和哭泣来释放恐惧。新生婴儿在哀悼失去在母亲体内安全、完全被包容的生活时，发出的第一个愤怒的哭声不仅是为了呼唤滋养和关注，也是为了释放她的恐惧。

In the dysfunctional family however, the traumatizing parent soon eradicates the child’s capacity to emote. The child becomes afraid and ashamed of her own tears and anger. Tears get shut off and anger gets trapped inside and is eventually turned against the self as self-attack, self-hate, self-disgust, and self-rejection. Self-hate is the most grievous reenactment of parental abandonment.

然而，在功能失调的家庭中，创伤性的父母很快就会消除孩子表达情感的能力。孩子开始害怕和羞愧自己的眼泪和愤怒。眼泪被关闭，愤怒被囚禁在内心，最终转化为自我攻击、自我仇恨、自我厌恶和自我拒绝。自我仇恨是父母遗弃的最悲惨的重演。

Over time, anger also becomes fuel for the critic and actually exacerbates fear by creating an increasingly dangerous internal environment. Anything the survivor says, thinks, feels, imagines or wishes for is subjected to an intimidating inner attack.

随着时间的推移，愤怒也成为了批评者的燃料，实际上通过创造一个越来越危险的内环境而加剧了恐惧。幸存者所说的、所想的、所感的、所想象的或所期望的一切都受到了令人畏惧的内心攻击。

[[null|]]Here are some common anger-powered critic attacks. They are presented in the first person voice, which the critic inevitably acquires: “Why did I ask such a stupid question?” “Could I have had an uglier expression on my face?” “Who am I kidding? How could an undeserving loser like me wish for love?” “No wonder I feel like sh\*t; I am a piece of sh\*t!”

这里是一些常见的愤怒驱动的批评攻击。它们以第一人称的语气呈现，这是批评者不可避免会获得的：“我怎么会问出这么愚蠢的问题？” “我脸上的表情难道不丑陋吗？” “我在骗谁呢？像我这样不配的失败者怎么可能渴望爱情？” “难怪我感觉糟糕透顶；我简直就是垃圾！”

Recovery is enhanced immeasurably by co-opting this anger from the critic and using it for the work of distancing from and shrinking the critic, as we shall see below. As you become proficient at grieving, you will notice that your critic’s volume and intensity ebbs dramatically. In fact, without the aid of effective grieving, progress in critic shrinking can only go so far.

恢复效果因利用批评者的愤怒来从事远离和缩小批评者的工作而大大增强。正如我们下面将要看到的，随着你越来越擅长哀悼，你会注意到你的批评者的声音和强度会显著减弱。事实上，如果没有有效的哀悼，缩小批评者的进展只能到此为止。
