GRIEVING  
  
悲伤

Grieving is an irreplaceable tool for resolving the overwhelming feelings that arise during emotional flashbacks. Moreover, grieving is the key process for working through the host of losses that come from growing up in a Cptsd-inducing family.  
  
悲伤是解决情感闪回期间涌现的强烈情绪的不可替代的工具。此外，悲伤是处理在创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）诱导的家庭中成长所经历的一系列损失的关键过程。

We grieve the losses of childhood because these losses are like deaths of important parts of ourselves. Effective grieving brings these parts back to life. In this chapter we describe the healing that is available through the four practices of grieving: _angering, crying, verbal ventilating and feeling._  
  
我们为童年的损失而悲伤，因为这些损失就像是我们自身重要部分的死亡。有效的悲伤能够使这些部分重获新生。在本章中，我们描述了通过悲伤的四种实践——愤怒、哭泣、言语宣泄和感受——所能获得的疗愈。

If you find that crying or angering is inaccessible, does not help, or makes you feel worse, then your recovery work my need to focus more on deconstructing and shrinking your inner critic.  
  
如果你发现哭泣或愤怒难以接近、没有帮助，或者让你感觉更糟，那么你的康复工作可能需要更多地关注解构和缩小你内心的批评者。
