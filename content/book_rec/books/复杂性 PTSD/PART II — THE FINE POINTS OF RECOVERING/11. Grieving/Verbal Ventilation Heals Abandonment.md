\*\*Verbal Ventilation Heals Abandonment

言语释放缓解遗弃感\*\*

When we share what is emotionally important to us, we learn to connect with others in a meaningful and healing way. This applies to sharing concerns that excite and please us, as well as those that frighten or depress us. Perhaps there was no more detrimental consequence of our childhood abandonment than being forced to habitually hide our authentic selves. Many of us come out of childhood believing that what we have to say is as uninteresting to others as it was to our parents.

当我们分享对我们情感上重要的事情时，我们学会以有意义和治愈的方式与他人建立联系。这适用于分享那些让我们兴奋和高兴的担忧，也适用于那些让我们害怕或沮丧的担忧。也许我们童年遗弃的最有害的后果就是被迫习惯性地隐藏我们的真实自我。我们中的许多人长大成人后认为，我们想要说的话对别人来说就像对我们父母一样无趣。

We must repudiate this damaging legacy of the past. Verbal ventilation is _the_ key way that people make friends. It parallels the way tender touch, soothing voice, and welcoming facial expressions [[null|]]helps infants and toddlers establish bonding and attachment. When we practice the emotionally based communication of verbal ventilation in a safe environment, we repair the damage of not having had this need met in childhood. This in turn opens up the possibility of finally attaining the verbal-emotional intimacy that is an essential lifelong need for all human beings.

我们必须摒弃过去这种有害的遗产。言语宣泄是人们交友的关键方式。它类似于温柔触摸、舒缓的声音和欢迎的面部表情如何帮助婴儿和幼儿建立联系和依恋。当我们在一个安全的环境中实践基于情感的言语宣泄沟通时，我们修复了在童年时期未能满足这种需求所造成的伤害。这反过来又打开了最终实现言语情感亲密的可能性，这是所有人类终身必需的基本需求。

Committing to this type of practice typically requires courage and perseverance. Authentic sharing can be triggering, and sometimes flashes the survivor back to being punished or rejected for being vulnerable. Therapy, individual or group, can help greatly to overcome and work through these obstacles to vitalizing your self-expression.

致力于这种类型的实践通常需要勇气和毅力。真诚的分享可能会触发某些情绪，有时会让人回想起因脆弱而受到惩罚或被拒绝的经历。个体或团体治疗可以极大地帮助克服和解决这些障碍，以激发你的自我表达。
