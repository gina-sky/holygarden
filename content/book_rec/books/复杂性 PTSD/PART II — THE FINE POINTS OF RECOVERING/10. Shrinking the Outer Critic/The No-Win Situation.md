**The No-Win Situation  
  
无赢的局面**

While scaring us out of trusting others, the outer critic also pushes us to over-control them to make them safer. Over-controlling behaviors include shaming, excessive criticism, monologing \[conversational control\] and overall bossiness. An extreme example of the latter is the _no-win situation_, which is also known as the double bind. It is described in the vernacular as “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”\[Only the most severe fight types do this consciously. These types are found on the end of the narcissistic continuum where narcissism turns into sociopathy.\]  
  
外在批评家不仅让我们不敢信任他人，还推动我们过度控制他们，使他们更安全。过度控制的行为包括羞辱、过度批评、独白\[对话控制\]和总体上的专横。后者的一个极端例子就是无赢的局面，也被称为双重束缚。用通俗易懂的话来说就是“做也不是，不做也不是。”\[只有最严重的战斗类型才会自觉地这样做。这些类型位于自恋连续体的末端，自恋转变为社会病态。\]

Sterling was a fight type client of mine who was strongly narcissistic, but not sociopathic. He wanted me to prove that I was meticulously attending to his pause-less monologue by giving him an empathic “un hunh” at about the rate of once a paragraph. He would usually cue me to do this by ending a sentence with “You Know?”  
  
Sterling 是我的一位战斗型客户，他极度自恋，但并非精神变态。他希望我证明我正一丝不苟地倾听他那不间断的独白，通过在他每段话后给予他一次同情的“嗯哼”，大约每段一次。他通常会通过在句子末尾加上“你知道吗？”来提示我这样做。

Over time, I could usually tell when he was in a flashback because he would be bothered by the frequency or quality of my “un hunh.” He was alternately frustrated if I used too many or too few “un hunhs”. In the first instance he fumed: “Haven’t you ever heard of a rhetorical question?” In the alternate instance, his frustration flared out at my lack of sympathy because I was not responding with “un hunh” enough.  
  
随着时间的推移，我通常能分辨出他是否在回忆，因为他会因我“嗯哼”的频率或质量而感到烦恼。如果我用的“嗯哼”太多或太少，他都会感到沮丧。在前一种情况下，他会生气地说：“你难道从未听说过反问句吗？”在后一种情况下，他的挫败感因我“嗯哼”不够而爆发出来。

There is an inner critic version of the no-win situation. Howard came into a session with a 102 temperature and a raging case of the flu. He told me: “I was lying in bed fluctuating between the sweats and the chills, and the critic was kicking my ass. ‘You lazy, flakey piece of sh\*t! Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Get off your sorry ass and get to your appointment!’”  
  
有一种无赢局面的内在批评版本。霍华德带着 102 度的高温和一场严重的流感来参加了一次咨询。他告诉我：“我躺在床上，一会儿出冷汗，一会儿发冷，那个批评家一直在踢我的屁股。‘你这个懒散、无赖的东西！别再为自己的感受感到抱歉。从你那可怜的屁股上起来，去你的预约吧！’”

[[null|]]Howard then told me that he fought this for about fifteen minutes, but the critic finally won and he came. As he sat in my waiting room, the critic started in again: “You are such an idiot. How could you be so stupid to go out feeling like this? You masochistic loser, you’re just trying to kill yourself. Why do you even bother trying to get better?”  
  
霍华德告诉我，他为此抗争了大约十五分钟，但最终批评家赢了，他来了。当他坐在我的候诊室里时，批评家又开始指责：“你真是个白痴。你怎么会这么愚蠢，感觉这么糟糕还出去？你这个受虐狂，你只是在试图自杀。你为什么还要费心去尝试变得更好？”
