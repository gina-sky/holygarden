**MINDFULNESS AND SHRINKING THE OUTER CRITIC  
  
正念与缩小外在批评**

Reducing outer critic reactivity requires a great deal of mindfulness. This is as essential for fight types who act out aggressively, as it is for those trauma types who internally rant against the entire human group known as “F\*cking People!”. It is also of great importance for any survivor who is locked into alienation because of the judgmentalness of his outer critic.  
  
减少对外部批评的反应需要极大的 mindfulness。这对那些表现出攻击性行为的战斗类型的人来说是必要的，就像对那些对整个人类群体进行内部抱怨的创伤类型的人来说一样，这个群体被称为“该死的家伙！”。对于任何因为外部批评的评判性而陷入孤立状态的幸存者来说，这也非常重要。

Mindfulness, once again, is the process of becoming intricately aware of everything that is going on inside us, especially thoughts, images, feelings and sensations. In terms of outer critic work, it is essential that we become more mindful of both the cognitive and emotional content of our thoughts.  
  
mindfulness，再次强调，是变得对内心发生的一切有深刻了解的过程，尤其是思想、图像、感觉和感受。在外部批评工作中，我们必须更加关注我们思想的认知和情感内容。

This is the same as in inner critic work, where the two key fronts of critic shrinking are cognitive and emotional. Cognitive work in both cases involves the demolition and rebuilding processes of thought-stopping and thought substitution, respectively. And, emotional work in both instances is grief work. It is removing the critic’s fuel supply - the unexpressed childhood anger and the uncried tears of a lifetime of abandonment.  
  
这与内部批评工作相同，批评缩小的两个关键前沿是认知和情感。在这两种情况下，认知工作都涉及停止思考和思想替代的破坏和重建过程。而在这两种情况下，情感工作都是悲伤的工作。这是移除批评者的燃料供应——未表达的孩子愤怒和一生中被遗弃的未流出的眼泪。
