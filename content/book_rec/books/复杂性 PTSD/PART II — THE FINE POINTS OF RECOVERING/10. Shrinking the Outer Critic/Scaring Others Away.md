**Scaring Others Away  
  
吓跑他人**

To avoid the vulnerability of being close, the outer critic can also broadcast from the various inner critic endangerment program. Catastrophizing out loud can be very triggering to others and can be an unconscious way of making them afraid of us.  
  
为了避免亲密关系的脆弱性，外在的批评家也可以通过各种内在的批评危害程序进行广播。大声灾难化可能会对他人产生很大的刺激，这可能是一种无意识的方式，让他们害怕我们。

One of my basketball-playing acquaintances is addicted to listening to a local, doom-and-gloom news station. He has managed to alienate everyone in our gym by his non-stop proselytizing about the catastrophic demise of our times. One of the players joked that he will not pass him the ball anymore because he thinks the guy believes that it is impossible for it to go through the hoop.  
  
我有一个打篮球的熟人，他沉迷于收听一个当地的末日新闻台。他通过不停地宣扬我们时代的灾难性灭亡，成功地将我们健身房里的每个人都疏远了。其中一位球员开玩笑说，他不会再把球传给他，因为他觉得这个人认为球不可能穿过篮筐。

Survivors who unnecessarily frighten others by excessively broadcasting about all the possible things that could go wrong rarely endear themselves to others. Moreover, they “force” others to avoid and abandon them when their _negative noticing_ reaches a critical mass and becomes noise pollution.  
  
那些不必要地通过过度传播所有可能出错的事情来吓唬他人的人，很少能赢得他人的喜爱。此外，当他们的负面关注达到临界点并成为噪音污染时，他们“强迫”他人避开和放弃他们。
