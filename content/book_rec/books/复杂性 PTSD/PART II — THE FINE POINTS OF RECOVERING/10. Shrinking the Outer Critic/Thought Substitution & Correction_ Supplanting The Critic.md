\*\*Thought Substitution And Correction: Supplanting the Critic

思维替代与纠正：取代批评\*\*

Many of us are still developmentally arrested in our need to orient our psyches towards noticing what is good, trustworthy and loveable about others and life in general. In working to shrink the outer critic, thought substitution is the practice of invoking positive [[null|]]thoughts and images of others to help erode the critic’s intimacy-spoiling habit of picking them apart.

我们中的许多人仍然在心理发展上停滞不前，需要将我们的心理调整到关注他人和生活中美好、值得信赖和可爱之处。在努力缩小外在批评的声音时，思维替代是一种通过唤起对他人积极思考和图像来帮助侵蚀批评者破坏亲密关系的习惯，即挑剔他人。

One helpful thought substitution exercise is to list five recollections of positive interactions with a given friend, as well as five of her attributes. This same technique works well when we self-apply it to help us separate from our inner critic’s negative self-image. [[Toolbox 5. Self-Gratitudes_ Gratitudes about Others|Toolbox 5]], in [[16. Self-Help Tools|chapter 16]], contains a written exercise to broaden your appreciation of select others who have benefitted you.

一种有用的思维替换练习是列出与某个朋友之间五个积极的互动回忆，以及她的五个特质。当我们自己应用这种技巧来帮助我们摆脱内心批评者的负面自我形象时，这种方法同样有效。第 16 章的工具箱 5 包含一项书面练习，旨在拓宽你对那些曾帮助你的人的欣赏。

Since thoughts typically give rise to speech, I also recommend that you practice the “5 positives to 1 negative” guideline when giving feedback to a loved one. John Gottman’s research has shown that this ratio is characteristic of how intimacy-successful couples communicate. This is also key because the outer critic was spawned in childhood by parental modeling that at least reversed this ratio.

由于思想通常会导致言语，我也建议你在向亲人反馈时练习“5 个积极 1 个消极”的准则。约翰·戈特曼的研究表明，这个比例是亲密关系成功的夫妻沟通的特征。这也很关键，因为外在批评是在童年时期由父母的榜样激发的，至少是逆转了这个比例。
