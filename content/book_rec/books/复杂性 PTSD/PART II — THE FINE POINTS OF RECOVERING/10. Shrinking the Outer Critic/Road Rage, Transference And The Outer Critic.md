\*\*Road Rage, Transference And The Outer Critic

路怒症、移情与外部批评者\*\*

Let us take another look at how the outer critic displaces anger from the past onto present-day relationships.

让我们再次看看外部批评者是如何将过去的愤怒转移到现在的关系中。

My client Johnny came in for his session boiling with road rage. Something infuriating had just occurred on his drive to my office. Before his butt hit the couch, he launched away: “That pompous SOB! People are so obnoxious. Everyone drives like they are the only ones on the road. What a jerk. Driving like he owns the whole road. Not giving a sh\*t about anybody but himself. Nobody cares about anybody but themselves. Oh god! Don’t let me get started on my wife. I don’t know why I get out of bed in the morning. This jerk must have forgotten what turn signals are for. I felt like crashing right into that stuck-up bastard and his shiny new Beamer!”

我的客户约翰尼来参加他的疗程，怒火中烧。在他开车来我办公室的路上，发生了一件让他非常愤怒的事情。他屁股还没坐到沙发上，就爆发了：“那个自大的混蛋！人们都这么讨厌。每个人都像自己是路上唯一的人一样开车。真是个混蛋。像他那样开车，好像整个路都是他的。对别人一点兴趣都没有，只关心自己。没有人关心别人，只关心自己。哦，上帝！别让我开始说我的妻子。我不知道我为什么早上会起床。这个混蛋肯定忘了转向灯是干什么的。我恨不得直接撞上那个傲慢的家伙和他的那辆闪亮的新宝马！”

Johnny radiated anger a full 360 degrees. He hated the driver who had cut him off, all the other drivers on the road, his wife, his employees, his neighbors, the government, and last - but thankfully least - his “overcharging therapist” who was always pretending to be “soooo empathetic.”

约翰尼 360 度全方位地散发着愤怒。他恨那个超车的司机，路上所有的其他司机，他的妻子，他的员工，他的邻居，政府，最后但幸运的是最少的，是他的“过度收费的治疗师”，他总是假装“非常同情。”

Johnny was a fawn-fight type. Usually he was mostly fawn. In our two years of working together, I had never seen him so enraged, and I was quite taken aback. I was indeed straining to hold an empathic position, but I knew he was in a flashback.

约翰尼是那种会激烈争吵的人。通常他大部分时间都很温顺。在我们合作的两年的时间里，我从未见过他这么愤怒，我感到非常震惊。我确实在努力保持同情的态度，但我知道他正处于一种闪回状态。

I encouraged him to further ventilate by hitting a tennis racket on a cushion. \[This is a classic anger-release work technique for [[null|]]externalizing anger in a non-harmful way\]. Johnny beat it like his life depended on it.

我鼓励他通过在枕头上击打网球拍来进一步宣泄情绪。\[这是一种经典的愤怒释放工作技巧，以非伤害性的方式外化愤怒\]。约翰尼像他的生命依赖于它一样地击打着。

When his catharting petered out, I asked him to close his eyes. I then suggested that he ask himself if his feelings of outrage had a trail into the past. After a moment he said: “I’m so mad. I don’t want to do anything that you say right now. And it’s weird because I know you’re fishing for my father, but I keep thinking of my mother. She was such a wimp! She’d never drive like that asshole in the Beamer, and she didn’t rant and rave at me like he did, but you know I just feel so pissed at her for putting up with him for all those years, and never once standing up for me or protecting me. It’s bad enough I got him for father, but it’s even more unfair that I got her too”.

当他的宣泄逐渐减弱时，我让他闭上眼睛。然后我建议他问问自己，他的愤怒情绪是否追溯到了过去。过了一会儿，他说：“我太生气了。我现在不想做你说的任何事。而且很奇怪，我知道你在钓我父亲的鱼，但我总是想起我的母亲。她是个胆小鬼！她绝不会像那个开宝马的混蛋那样开车，她也不会像他那样对我大喊大叫，但你知道，我真的很生气，因为她忍受了他那么多年，从没有一次为我站出来或保护我。我已经有了他作为父亲，但更不公平的是，我也得到了她。”

Johnny did another round of venting with the tennis racket: “I thought mothers were programmed to stick up for their kids! You know, like that mother bear sh\*t. It’s so unfair…it’s so un-f\*cken-believably unfair. I’d just like to shake her out of that numb trance she’d go into. Just shake some freaking sense into her!”

约翰尼又用网球拍发泄了一通：“我以为妈妈们天生就是保护孩子的！就像那只母熊一样。这太不公平了……太他妈不公平了。我真想把她从那种麻木的迷梦中摇醒。把她那该死的理智摇醒！”

And then the tears came. Shortly after they subsided, the epiphany arrived. It made him laugh. Genuinely. It was the laughter of relief that we sometimes get when we finally understand why something is really bothering us. He said: “You know this sounds pretty far-fetched and like that psychobabble I hate, but it’s the goddamn unfairness of life that just pisses me off so much. You know that you-got-the-queen-of-spades bad luck. That bad luck of being the one person in the crowd who gets crapped on by a pigeon. That cursed luck of getting dealt those assholes from the parenting deck. It’s so goddamned unfair! Dad and mom’s unfairness was f\*cking legendary!

然后眼泪涌了出来。不久之后，顿悟降临。这让他笑了。真的笑了。这是当我们终于明白为什么某件事真的困扰我们时，我们有时会得到的释然之笑。他说：“你知道这听起来很牵强，就像我讨厌的心理学术语，但就是生活的这种不公平让我如此愤怒。你知道你得到了黑桃 Q 的坏运气。那种在人群中成为被鸽子拉屎的人的坏运气。那种被抽到育儿牌堆里的混蛋的诅咒运气。这太不公平了！爸爸和妈妈的坏运气是传奇般的！”

“And that jerk on the freeway making a lane change without signaling was unfair too. I mean if I hadn’t seen him, I could have gotten into a serious accident. But if I’m honest, it wasn’t really all that bad. I had plenty of time to adjust, and would have been a lousy driver myself if I hadn’t.

“高速公路上那个不打信号灯就变道的混蛋也太不公平了。我的意思是，如果我没看到他，我可能会遇到严重的车祸。但说实话，那其实也没那么糟糕。我有足够的时间调整，如果不是这样的话，我自己也会是个糟糕的司机。

[[null|]]“But, I mean it was still dangerous though. But nothing compared to growing up in that house. Now that was pure, unadulterated danger for you. I guess my rage was mostly about how unfair it was that I had to grow up in that sorry excuse for a home.”

“但是，我还是觉得那还是很危险的。但和在那个家里长大相比，那算不了什么。现在那才是真正的、纯粹的危险。我想我的愤怒大部分是关于我不得不在那个可怜的借口般的家里长大的不公平。”

Road rage and the less intense irritations we experience with our fellow drivers are common forms of outer critic transference. When we become more mindful of our driving frustrations or other minor everyday annoyances, we can look below the tip of this iceberg for old unexpressed anger and hurt that it reminds us of.

路怒症和我们在同行司机身上经历的轻微的烦恼都是外部批评转移的常见形式。当我们更加关注我们的驾驶挫折或其他日常小烦恼时，我们可以看到这个冰山一角下面的旧未表达出的愤怒和伤害，它让我们想起了这些。”

I encourage you to experiment with this next time you are inordinately angry at some driver for a relatively minor driving mistake. You can try asking yourself: “What is this situation or feeling reminding me of?” In the [[11. Grieving|next chapter]], we will explore more deeply the processes of grieving through the old hurts that we discover when we get to the bottom of our flashbacks.

我鼓励你在下次因为某个相对较小的驾驶错误而极度愤怒时进行实验。你可以试着问自己：“这种情况或感觉让我想起了什么？”在下一章中，我们将更深入地探讨通过我们在回忆的底层发现的旧伤痛来哀悼的过程。
