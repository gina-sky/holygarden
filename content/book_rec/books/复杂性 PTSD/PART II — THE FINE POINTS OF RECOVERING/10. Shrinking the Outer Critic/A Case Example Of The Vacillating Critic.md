**A Case Example Of The Vacillating Critic  
  
摇摆不定批评者的案例示例**

My wife and I have been living together for more than a decade. We have come a long way in negotiating what seems to both of us - most of the time – a fair and flexible approach to handling the innumerable tasks involved in running a household with a young child. But sometimes, when I am experiencing an extended flashback, I start over-noticing imperfections in the general household order.  
  
我和妻子已经共同生活了十多年。我们在处理抚养小孩的家庭琐事方面已经走了很长的路，这对我们俩来说——大多数时候——似乎是一个公平和灵活的方法。但有时，当我经历长时间的回忆时，我开始过分关注家庭秩序中的不完美。

Where the critic first points the finger varies. If I am triggered into tired survival mode, the inner critic can launch into berating me for my sub-standard contribution. If on the other hand I am triggered into flight mode and have been speed-cleaning, my outer critic can start keeping score. In this latter mode, my outer critic can perseverate about how little my wife is doing compared to me. The comparisons are typically in the areas where I have recently been over-contributing.  
  
批评者首先指责的地方各不相同。如果我进入了疲惫的生存模式，内在的批评者可能会开始责备我贡献不足。另一方面，如果我进入了逃避模式并进行了快速清洁，外在的批评者可能会开始计分。在这种模式下，外在的批评者可能会固执地认为妻子与我相比做得太少。这些比较通常是在我最近过度贡献的领域。

But my fawn side is pretty strong and before too long, I can start noticing all the venues where I do not contribute as much as she. And suddenly I am the selfish slacker of the family. As the flashback continues, I may then flip into berating myself for being picky and ungenerous.  
  
但我的顺从性相当强，不久之后，我开始注意到我不如她贡献的地方。突然间，我成了家庭中的自私懒汉。随着回忆的持续，我可能会开始责备自己挑剔和不慷慨。

In an especially strong flash back, the outer critic will come back sooner or later and start assigning more weight and importance to my contributions, and then belittle her for being, slack, thoughtless, self-involved, etc.  
  
在一个特别强烈的闪回中，外部批评者迟早会回来，开始赋予我的贡献更多的重量和重要性，然后贬低她，说她懒散、粗心、自私等。

In our early relationship I could loop this loop for quite some time, losing hours even days to feeling disaffected from my wife, and from myself. My peace of mind would deteriorate into an inner battleground of feeling abandoned by her while simultaneously judging myself for abandoning her. In the worst flashbacks, the [[null|]]process did not stay internal, and we would have conflicts about this issue.  
  
在我们的早期关系中，我可以长时间地陷入这个循环，甚至失去几个小时甚至几天的时间，感到对妻子和我自己感到不满。我的平静心态会恶化成一种内心的战场，一方面感到被她抛弃，另一方面又评判自己抛弃了她。在最糟糕的闪回中，这个过程并没有停留在内部，我们会在这个问题上发生冲突。

These days conflict rarely occurs over chores. Because of what I have learned about the outer critic, internal looping about this has also decreased immeasurably. Mindfulness about my outer and inner critic processes allows me to identify them sooner and rescue myself and my relationship from them much more quickly.  
  
如今，冲突很少发生在家务事上。因为我已经学到了关于外部批评者的知识，关于这个问题的内心循环也大大减少了。对外部和内心批评者过程的正念让我能够更快地识别它们，并更快地从中拯救自己和我的关系。

The scenario above is also a typical example of what worrying looks like in a flashback.  
  
上述情况也是担忧在闪回中表现出的典型例子。
