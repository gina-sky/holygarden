**Healthy Outer Critic Venting  
  
健康的外在批评宣泄**

There are times when venting from the outer critic perspective is healthy, self-protective behavior. Sometimes the outer critic’s judgments are accurate. Sometimes people are acting as abusively as our [[null|]]parents did in childhood. In this vein, there are two healthy applications of outer critic aggressiveness. One is to protect ourselves when someone is actually attacking us. The other is in the work of grieving the losses of childhood. As we shall see in the [[11. Grieving|next chapter]], survivors benefit immeasurably from angrily judging their parents’ atrocious abuse and negligence.  
  
有时，从外部批评者的角度来看进行宣泄是健康的、自我保护的行为。有时外部批评者的判断是准确的。有时人们的行为就像我们童年时父母对我们那样具有伤害性。在这方面，外部批评者的攻击性有两个健康的运用。一是当有人实际上攻击我们时保护自己。二是处理童年失去的工作。正如我们将在下一章中看到的，幸存者从愤怒地评判父母可怕的家暴和疏忽中受益匪浅。
