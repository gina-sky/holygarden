\*\*Refusing To Give Voice To The Critic’s Point Of View

拒绝表达批评者的观点\*\*

The outer critic is the author of this intimacy-spoiling program*: Being honest to a fault*. In the guise of honesty, the outer critic can negatively notice only what is imperfect in another. Under the spell of perfectionism, the outer critic can tear the other apart by laundry-listing his normal weaknesses and foibles. When challenged about this many fight types will respond that: “I was just trying to be honest!”

外在的批评者是破坏亲密关系的程序的作者：过分诚实。在外在的批评者看来，诚实就是只注意到别人不完美的地方。在完美主义的魔咒下，外在的批评者可以通过列举对方的正常弱点和缺点来拆散对方。当被质疑这一点时，许多战斗类型的人会回应说：“我只是想诚实而已！”

The inner critic has its own version of excessive honesty which I sometimes call “beating you to the punch.” Afraid of being criticized \[as in childhood\], the inner critic can launch the survivor into a “confession” of her every defect in hopes of short-circuiting anyone else from bringing them up. Sometimes hearing the criticism from yourself feels less hurtful than hearing it from someone else. After all, it’s old news to you and your critic.

内心批评家有其版本的超诚实，我有时称之为“先发制人”。害怕被批评\[就像童年时那样\]，内心批评家可能会让幸存者“忏悔”她所有的缺点，希望阻止任何人提出这些缺点。有时，听到自己的批评比听到别人的批评更不伤人。毕竟，这对你和你的批评家来说都是老生常谈。

I subscribe to authenticity as one of my highest values, but it does not include sharing my outer critic’s view of you or exposing my inner critic’s unfair judgments of me.

我视真诚为我的最高价值观之一，但这并不包括分享我对外部批评家的看法或揭露我内心批评家对我不公平的评判。

As stated earlier, the toxic critic is not an authentic part of us. We were not born with it. We were indoctrinated with it by parents who viewed us in an extremely negative and jaundiced way. Because of this, we need to protect our intimates from its distorted and destructive judgments. Just as importantly, we need to protect ourselves from alienating people by presenting ourselves as if we are so defective that we do not deserve to be loved.

如前所述，有毒的批评家不是我们真实的部分。我们并非与生俱来就有它。我们被父母以极端消极和偏见的观点所洗脑。因此，我们需要保护我们的亲密关系免受其扭曲和破坏性评判的影响。同样重要的是，我们需要保护自己，避免通过展示自己的缺陷，以至于不值得被爱的方式来疏远他人。
