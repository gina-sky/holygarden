**Watching The News As A Trigger  
  
将看新闻作为触发点**

Sometimes the outer critic’s penchant for raising false alarms ensnares us with an insatiable hunger for listening to the news. When we do not resist this junk food feeding of our psyches with a news “service” that exults so thoroughly in the negative, we can be left floundering in a dreadful hypervigilance.  
  
有时外评家喜欢拉响虚假警报的倾向，会让我们陷入对新闻的无法满足的渴望。当我们不对这种心理“服务”进行抵制，这种“服务”在负面消息上如此狂热，我们可能会陷入可怕的过度警觉。

The critic can then work overtime to amass irrefutable proof that the world is unforgivably dangerous. Isolation, and minimal or superficial relating, is therefore, our only recourse. At such times any inclination to call a friend triggers images of rejection and humiliation before the phone can even be picked up. When flashbacks are particularly intense, impulses to venture out may immediately trigger fantasies of being verbally harassed or even mugged on the street.  
  
评论家可以加班加点地搜集世界不可饶恕地危险的铁证。因此，孤立和最小化或肤浅的社交是我们唯一的出路。在这样的时刻，任何想要打电话给朋友的念头都会在拿起电话之前引发被拒绝和羞辱的景象。当闪回特别强烈时，外出冒险的冲动可能会立即引发被言语骚扰甚至街头抢劫的幻想。

In worse case scenarios, outer critic drasticizing deteriorates into paranoia. At its worst paranoia deteriorates into fantasies and delusions of persecution. I remember one horribly, humiliating experience that occurred in my early twenties on an occasion when I was very sleep-deprived. I was sitting on a park bench struggling to concentrate on the book I was reading. I had read the same short paragraph four times and barely registered a word of it. At the same time, I was becoming more and more aware of a group of people who had sat down behind me. I started feeling ashamed because they were having a great time while I sat there painfully self-conscious and despondent.  
  
在最糟糕的情况下，外在评论家的极端化会演变成偏执。在最严重的情况下，偏执会演变成被追捕的幻想和错觉。我记得在我二十多岁时发生的一个可怕、羞辱的经历，那是在我非常缺乏睡眠的时候。我坐在公园的长椅上，努力集中精力阅读我正在读的书。我已经读了同样的短段落四次，几乎没记住一个字。与此同时，我越来越意识到一群人坐在我的后面。我开始感到羞愧，因为他们玩得很开心，而我却坐在那里痛苦地自我意识过剩和绝望。

Suddenly I realized they were talking disparagingly about me. I was too scared to turn around. Their comments became steadily more insulting. Their loud laughter became increasingly mocking. In my mind’s I eye I could see them all staring and pointing at me: “Look at that sorry-ass loser. He’s pretending he’s not even listening!” Finally, in desperation, I turned around and croaked out a weak “What’s going on?”  
  
我突然意识到他们正在贬低地谈论我。我太害怕了，不敢回头。他们的评论变得越来越侮辱性。他们的大声笑声变得越来越嘲讽。在我脑海中，我能看到他们所有人都在盯着我指指点点：“看那个可怜的失败者。他假装自己甚至没在听！”最后，在绝望中，我转过身，用微弱的声音喊道：“怎么了？”

[[null|]]I was shocked and even more mortified at the same time. They were not even looking at me. They were so immersed in their joyful banter that they did not even notice that I turned around and spoke. It became immediately obvious to me that it was a terrible figment of my imagination. I slunk away in shame and had to wait decades to understand how my Cptsd and the outer critic had manufactured this terrible paranoia.  
  
我震惊了，同时感到更加羞愧。他们甚至没有看我。他们如此沉浸在愉快的闲聊中，以至于没有注意到我转过身说话。我立刻意识到，那完全是我想象出来的。我羞愧地溜走，不得不等上几十年才明白我的创伤后应激障碍和外在批评是如何制造出这种可怕的偏执的。
