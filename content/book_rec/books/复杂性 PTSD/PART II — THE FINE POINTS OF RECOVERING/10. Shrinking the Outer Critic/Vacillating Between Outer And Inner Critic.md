**VACILLATING BETWEEN OUTER AND INNER CRITIC  
  
在内外批评之间摇摆不定**

Many Cptsd survivors flounder in caustic judgmentalness, shuffling back and forth between pathologizing others \[the toxic blame of the outer critic\] and pathologizing themselves \[the toxic shame of the inner critic\]. They get stuck in endless loops of detailing the relational inadequacies of others, and then of themselves.  
  
许多 PTSD 幸存者在刻薄的评判中挣扎，在将他人病理化\[外批评的有毒指责\]和将自身病理化\[内批评的有毒羞愧\]之间来回摇摆。他们陷入了对他人关系不足的无限循环中，然后又转向自己。

[[null|]]My parents’ twisted version of this boiled down to: “As f\*cked up as we are, we’re still way better than you”. Karen Horney described this trauma two-step as all-or-none lurching between the polarities of the _grandiose self_ and the _despised self_.  
  
我父母的这种扭曲版本归结为：“我们虽然很糟糕，但我们仍然远远比你强”。卡伦·霍尼将这种创伤两步法描述为在夸大的自我和被鄙视的自我之间全有或全无的跳跃。

When we become lost in this process, we miss out on our crucial emotional need to experience a sense of belonging. We live in permanent estrangement oscillating between the extremes of too good for others or too unlikeable to be included. This is the excruciating social perfectionism of the Janus-faced critic: others are too flawed to love and we are too defective to be lovable.  
  
当我们迷失在这个过程中时，我们错过了体验归属感这一至关重要的情感需求。我们生活在永久的疏离中，在过于优秀以至于无法被他人接受或过于不受欢迎以至于无法被包括在内的极端之间摇摆。这就是两面派批评家痛苦的社会完美主义：他人太过有缺陷而无法被爱，而我们太过有缺陷而无法被爱。

A verbal diagram of a typical critic-looping scenario looks like this. The outer critic’s judgmentalness is activated by the need to escape the “in-danger” feeling that is triggered by socializing. Even the thought of relating can set off our disapproval programs so that we feel justified in isolating. Extended withdrawal however, reawakens our relational hunger and our impulses to connect. This simultaneously reverses the critic from outer to inner mode. The critic then laundry lists our inadequacies, convincing us that we are too odious to others to socialize. This then generates self-pitying persecution fantasies, which eventually re-invites the outer critic to build a case about how awful people are…ad infinitum…ad nauseam. This looping then keeps us “safe” in the hiding of silent disengagement.  
  
一个典型的批评循环场景的口头图示是这样的。外部批评者的评判性是由逃避社交时触发的“危险”感所激活的。甚至只是想到建立联系也能触发我们的反对程序，让我们觉得有理由孤立自己。然而，长期的退缩却重新唤醒了我们的关系渴望和连接的冲动。这同时使批评者从外部模式转变为内部模式。然后，批评者列举我们的不足，说服我们认为自己对他人来说太令人厌恶，不适合社交。这进而产生了自我怜悯的迫害幻想，最终再次邀请外部批评者构建关于人们多么糟糕的案件……无穷无尽……令人作呕。这种循环让我们在沉默的疏离中“安全”地隐藏起来。

When it emanates from the inner critic direction, the vacillating critic can look like this. The survivor’s negative self-noticing drives her to strive to be perfect. She works so hard and incessantly at it that she begins to resent others who do not. Once the resentment accumulates enough, a minor faux pas in another triggers her to shift into extreme outer critic disappointment and frustration. She then silently perseverates and laundry lists “people” for all their faults and betrayals. How long she remains polarized to the outer critic usually depends on her 4F type, but sooner or later she starts to feel guilty about this, and suddenly the inner critic is back on line [[null|]]judging her harshly for being so judgmental. The cataloguing of her own defects then resumes in earnest.  
  
当它来自内心批评的方向时，摇摆不定的批评者可能看起来是这样的。幸存者的负面自我注意驱使她努力追求完美。她为此付出了巨大的努力，不知疲倦，以至于开始怨恨那些做不到的人。一旦怨恨积累到一定程度，另一个人的小错误就会触发她进入极端的外部批评失望和挫败。然后她默默地反复思考，列出“人们”的所有缺点和背叛。她对外部批评的极化通常取决于她的 4F 类型，但迟早她会因为这种自我批评而感到内疚，然后内心批评又上线，严厉地评判她如此评判他人。然后她开始认真地列出自己的缺陷。
