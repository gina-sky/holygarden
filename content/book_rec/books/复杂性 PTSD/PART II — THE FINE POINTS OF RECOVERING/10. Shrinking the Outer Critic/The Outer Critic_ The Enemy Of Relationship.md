**THE OUTER CRITIC: THE ENEMY OF RELATIONSHIP  
  
外在批评者：关系的敌人**

In Cptsd, the critic can have two aspects: inner critic and outer critic. The inner critic is the part of your mind that views you as flawed and unworthy. The outer critic is the part that views everyone else as flawed and unworthy. When the outer critic is running your mind, people appear to be too awful and too dangerous to trust.  
  
在 PTSD 中，批评者可以有两个方面：内在批评者和外在批评者。内在批评者是你心中认为你自身有缺陷和不值得的部分。外在批评者则是认为其他人都有缺陷和不值得的部分。当外在批评者控制了你的思维时，人们似乎太可怕、太危险，无法信任。

When she was stuck in an outer critic attack, one of my clients would often rant like this: “Everybody s\*cks. People are so selfish and scary. They either f\*ck you over or they let you down.” She eventually named this an “I’m-moving-to-another-planet flashback.”  
  
当我的一个客户陷入外在批评者的攻击时，她经常会这样抱怨：“所有人都很糟糕。人们如此自私和可怕。他们要么背叛你，要么让你失望。”她最终把这称为“我要搬到另一个星球上的闪回”。

The _outer critic_ is the counterpart of the self-esteem-destroying inner critic. It uses the same programs of perfectionism and endangerment against others that your inner critic uses against yourself. [[null|]]Via its all-or-none programming, the outer critic rejects others because they are never perfect and cannot be guaranteed to be safe.  
  
外部批评者是自我价值感破坏型内心批评者的对应物。它使用与你的内心批评者对你自己使用的相同的完美主义和威胁程序来对待他人。通过其全有或全无的编程，外部批评者拒绝他人，因为他们从不完美，也无法保证安全。

As with the inner critic, outer critic attacks are usually internal and silent, unless you are a fight type as we will see below.  
  
与内心批评者一样，外部批评者的攻击通常是内部和无声的，除非你是我们下面将要看到的战斗类型。

When we regress into the outer critic, we obsess about the unworthiness \[imperfection\] and treacherousness \[dangerousness\] of others. Unconsciously, we do this to avoid emotional investment in relationships.  
  
当我们退行到外部批评者时，我们会痴迷于他人的不值得（不完美）和背叛性（危险性）。无意识地，我们这样做是为了避免在人际关系中投入情感。

The outer critic developed in reaction to parents who were too dangerous to trust. The outer critic helped us to be hyperaware of the subtlest signal that our parents were deteriorating into their most dangerous behaviors. Over time the outer critic grew to believe that anyone and everyone would inevitably turn out to be as untrustworthy as our parents.  
  
外部批评者是在对那些过于危险而无法信任的父母做出反应时发展起来的。外部批评者帮助我们高度警觉地察觉到我们的父母正在恶化到最危险的行为的微妙信号。随着时间的推移，外部批评者逐渐相信任何人，包括我们自己，最终都会变得像我们的父母一样不可信任。

Now, in situations where we no longer need it, the outer critic alienates us from others. It attacks others and scares them away, or it builds fortresses of isolation whose walls are laundry lists of their exaggerated shortcomings. In an awful irony, the critic attempts to protect us from abandonment by scaring us further into it.  
  
现在，在我们不再需要它的情况下，外在批评者使我们与他人疏远。它攻击他人，使他们远离，或者它建造起隔离的堡垒，其墙壁是夸大其词的缺点清单。在一种可怕的讽刺中，批评者试图通过进一步恐吓我们，来保护我们免受遗弃。

If we are ever to discover the comfort of soothing connection with others, the critic’s dictatorship of the mind must be broken. The outer critic’s arsenal of intimacy-spoiling dynamics must be consciously identified and gradually deactivated.  
  
如果我们想要发现与他人之间舒缓的联系带来的安慰，就必须打破批评者对心灵的独裁。必须有意识地识别外在批评者的破坏亲密关系的动态，并逐渐使其失效。
