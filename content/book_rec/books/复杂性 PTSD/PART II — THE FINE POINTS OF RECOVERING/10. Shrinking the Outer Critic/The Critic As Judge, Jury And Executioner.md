**THE CRITIC AS JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER  
  
批评家作为法官、陪审团和行刑者**

As noted above, not all survivors hide their outer critic. Fight types and subtypes can take the passive out of passive-aggressive and become quite aggressive. The survivor who is polarized to the outer critic often develops a specious belief that his subjectively derived standards of correctness are objective truth. When triggered, he can use the critic’s combined detective-lawyer-judge function to prosecute the other for betrayal with little or no evidence. Imagined slights, insignificant peccadilloes, misread facial expressions, and inaccurate “psychic” perceptions can be used to put relationships on trial. In the proceedings, the outer critic typically refuses to admit positive evidence. Extenuating circumstances will not be considered in this kangaroo court. Moreover any relational disappointment can render a guilty verdict that sentences the relationship to capital punishment. This is also the process by which jealousy can become toxic and run riot.  
  
如上所述，并非所有幸存者都隐藏他们的外在批评者。战斗类型和亚型可以消除被动攻击性中的被动，变得相当具有攻击性。那些对外在批评者极端偏执的幸存者常常会形成一种虚假信念，认为他们主观上得出的正确标准是客观真理。一旦被触发，他们可以利用批评者的侦探-律师-法官组合功能，几乎无需证据就对他人进行背叛的指控。想象中的轻蔑、微不足道的过失、误解的面部表情和不准确的“心灵”感知都可以用来审判关系。在审判过程中，外在批评者通常拒绝承认积极证据。在这个 kangaroo court 中，不会考虑减轻情节。此外，任何关系上的失望都可能得出有罪的判决，将关系判处死刑。这也是嫉妒变得有毒并横行的过程。

On another level, the outer critic is skilled at building a case to justify occupying a higher moral ground. From this lofty position, the critic then claims the right to micromanage others. Typically [[null|]]this is rationalized as being for the other’s own good. This control, however, is usually wielded on an unconscious level to protect the survivor from any reenactment of early parental abuse or neglect.  
  
在另一个层面上，外部批评者擅长构建一个案例来为自己的道德优越感辩护。从这个崇高的位置出发，批评者随后声称有权对他人进行微观管理。通常，这种控制被合理化为是为了他人的自身利益。然而，这种控制通常是在无意识层面上实施的，以保护幸存者免受早期父母虐待或忽视的重演。

Micromanagement of others also devolves into a host of controlling behaviors. Fight types treat others like captive audiences, give them unsolicited performance evaluations, make unreasonable demands for improvement, and control their time schedules, social calendars and food and clothing choices. In worse case scenarios, they dramatically act out their jealousy, often without cause. At its absolute worst, outer critic relating looks like taking prisoners, not making friends.  
  
对他人进行微观管理也会演变成一系列控制行为。战斗型的人将他人视为被俘的观众，给予他们未经请求的工作评估，对改进提出不合理的要求，控制他们的时间表、社交日程以及食物和服装选择。在最糟糕的情况下，他们会戏剧性地表现出自己的嫉妒，往往没有原因。在最极端的情况下，外部批评者的关系看起来像是抓捕囚犯，而不是交朋友。
