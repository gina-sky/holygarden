**The Critic: Subliminal B-Grade Movie Producer  
  
批评家：潜意识 B 级电影制片人**

The outer critic typically arises most powerfully during emotional flashbacks. At such times, it transmutes unconscious abandonment pain into an overwhelmingly negative perception of people and of life in general. It obsessively fantasizes, consciously and unconsciously, about how people have or could hurt us.  
  
外部批评家通常在情绪闪回时最为强烈地出现。在那时，它将无意识的被遗弃的痛苦转化为对人们和生活的整体压倒性的负面看法。它痴迷地幻想，无论是意识还是无意识，人们是如何伤害我们的。

Over the years these fantasies typically expand from scary snapshots into film clips and even movies. Without realizing it, we can amass a video collection of real and imagined betrayals that destroy our capacity to be nurtured by human contact.  
  
多年来，这些幻想通常从恐怖的快照扩展到电影片段，甚至电影。没有意识到，我们可以积累起一个由真实和想象的背叛组成的视频收藏，这些背叛摧毁了我们被人类接触滋养的能力。

“Don’t trust anyone”, “Proud to be a loner”, “You can only depend on yourself”, “Lovers always leave you”, “Kids will break your heart”, “Only fools let on what they really think”, “Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile”, are titles of video themes survivors may develop in their quest for interpersonal safety.  
  
“不要相信任何人”，“以孤独为荣”，“只能依靠自己”，“恋人总会离开你”，“孩子会伤透你的心”，“只有傻瓜才会表露自己的真实想法”，“给他们一寸，他们会占一尺”，这些是幸存者在追求人际安全的过程中可能形成的视频主题标题。

These defensive and often subliminal daydreams are analogs of the critic-spawned nightmares that also shore up the “safety” work of frightening us into isolation. Over time, with enough recovery, intrusive anti-intimacy reveries become clues that we are actually in a flashback, and that we need to invoke our flashback management skills.  
  
这些防御性的、常常是无意识的白日梦是批评家引发的噩梦的类比，这些噩梦也巩固了“安全”工作，即通过恐吓我们进入孤立来巩固“安全”工作。随着时间的推移，通过足够的恢复，侵扰性的反亲密白日梦成为我们实际上处于闪回中的线索，以及我们需要调动我们的闪回管理技能的线索。

The dynamics of the outer critic are often obscured by minimization and denial. Its obsessions and “daymares” often occur just below the level of our awareness. They become subliminal via their repetitiveness like the sound of waves at the beach - like the sounds of traffic in the city - like the sound of the critic repetitively calling you or someone else a jerk, a loser, a dumbsh\*t!  
  
外评家的动态常常被最小化和否认所掩盖。它的痴迷和“白日梦”往往发生在我们意识水平之下。通过重复，它们变得潜意识，就像海滩上波浪的声音——就像城市中交通的声音——就像批评家反复地称呼你或别人是混蛋、失败者、笨蛋！
