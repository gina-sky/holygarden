**GRIEVING SHORTCIRCUITS THE OUTER CRITIC  
  
悲伤短路外在批评者**

The role of grieving in shrinking the outer critic is as crucial as it is with the inner critic. As with the inner critic, angering at the outer critic helps to silence it, and crying helps to evaporate it.  
  
悲伤在缩小外在批评者方面的作用，与对内在批评者的作用一样至关重要。就像内在批评者一样，对外在批评者的愤怒有助于使其沉默，而哭泣有助于使其消散。

We can use the anger of our grief to energize our thought corrections. This helps us to challenge the critic’s entrenched all-or-none perspective that everyone is as dangerous as our parents. Moreover, when our grieving opens into crying, it can release the fear that the outer critic uses to frighten us out of opening to others. Tears can also help us realize that our loneliness is now causing us much unnecessary pain. This in turn can motivate us to open to the possibility of finding safe connections.  
  
我们可以利用悲伤的愤怒来激发我们的思想修正。这有助于我们挑战批评者根深蒂固的全有或全无的视角，即每个人都有我们父母那样的危险。此外，当我们的悲伤转化为哭泣时，它可以释放外在批评者用来恐吓我们不敢向他人敞开心扉的恐惧。泪水还可以帮助我们意识到，我们的孤独现在正在给我们带来许多不必要的痛苦。这反过来又可以激励我们去接受找到安全连接的可能性。
