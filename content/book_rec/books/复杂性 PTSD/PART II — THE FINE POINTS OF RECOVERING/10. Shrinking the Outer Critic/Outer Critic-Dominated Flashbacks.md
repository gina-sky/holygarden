\*\*OUTER CRITIC-DOMINATED FLASHBACKS

外部批评家主导的闪回\*\*

Holly, an elderly client and a flight-fight type, was suffering minor, age-related memory loss. She started her session chuckling: “I was reading your article on the Outer Critic again last night. I didn’t really get it when I read it three years ago, but I get it now and I think it’s because my memory deterioration has a silver lining.

霍莉，一位年迈的客户，属于战斗-逃跑型，她正遭受轻微的与年龄相关的记忆力减退。她开始她的疗程时笑着说：“我昨晚又读了你关于外在批评者的文章。三年前我读的时候并不真正理解，但现在我明白了，我想这是因为我的记忆力衰退也有其积极的一面。”

[[null|]]“So, you know how I’m always blaming my husband whenever anything goes wrong at home. Well I’m starting to get that it’s an all-or-none, outer critic process that I get stuck in.

所以，你知道我总是把家里出问题归咎于我的丈夫。嗯，我开始意识到，我陷入了一种全有或全无的外部批评过程。

“I’ve been blaming him for misplacing or not putting things away for decades but I’ve started to notice that it’s me who often misplaces things. I was cooking a meal last night and looking for the food scissors that I use to cut up leafy vegetables. It wasn’t on the magnetic wall strip where I insist that we keep it, and I immediately started feeling very angry at him - and more and more angry as I searched in various drawers to no avail.

我已经几十年都在责怪他把东西放错地方或者不把东西放好，但开始注意到，常常是我自己把东西放错地方。昨晚我正在做饭，找用来切叶菜的食品剪刀。它不在我们坚持要放在那里的磁性墙条上，我立刻对他感到非常生气——而且随着我在各个抽屉里徒劳地寻找，我的怒气越来越大了。

“The longer I searched, the more exasperated I got, and sure enough, I found myself laundry-listing all his faults. My resentment rapidly escalated and peaked with me deciding that I really was going to leave him this time. As I continued to amass evidence that he was a terrible loser and that this was a wise decision, I went back to the stove and found the scissors where I’d left them five minutes ago. I could see the scraps of spinach still on them from when I’d cut it up over the pot!

“我越找越生气，果然，我发现自己正在一一列举他的缺点。我的怨恨迅速升级，达到顶点时我决定这次我真的要离开他。当我继续收集他是个糟糕的失败者以及这是一个明智决定的证据时，我回到了炉子旁，找到了我五分钟前放下的剪刀。我还能看到上面还残留着我从锅里切下的菠菜碎片！

“What a mortifying epiphany I had! - Especially since a similar thing had happened with the tooth paste the night before. I forgot I had put it in the medicine cabinet in one of my organizational upgrades, and I was convinced Frank had moved it from its proper place. I started reading him the riot act so intensely, that he pretended he had to get something out of the car. And then, when I went to the medicine cabinet for some aspirin, there it was where I had placed it myself!

“我有一个多么令人尴尬的顿悟！——尤其是在前一天晚上也发生了类似的事情，牙膏不见了。我忘记了我把牙膏放在了药柜里，这是我进行的一次组织升级，我确信弗兰克把它从原来的地方移走了。我开始对他大发雷霆，他假装要去车里拿东西。然后，当我去药柜找阿司匹林时，它就在我放的地方！

“Oh my god, that outer critic did an instant about face into becoming the inner critic. And then when it had contemptuously lambasted me to tears, I suddenly had another epiphany about how I would let any mistake on his part launch me into a two volume history of his past mistakes. I’d get so stuck in that negative noticing that I couldn’t call to mind a single good thing about this good enough husband that I’ve had for thirty-five years.”

“哦我的天哪，那个外在的批评家瞬间变成了内在的批评家。然后它轻蔑地责骂我，让我泪流满面，我突然又有了另一个顿悟，那就是我会如何让他的任何错误引发我对他的过去错误的两卷历史。我会如此陷入这种消极的注意中，以至于我想不起关于这位 35 年来一直陪伴我的好丈夫的任何优点。”

[[null|]]Holly and I spent a great deal of time fleshing this out. She could see that the outer critic typically triggered her into a very old feeling and belief that “People are so unreliable – they always let you down –they just can’t be trusted!”

霍莉和我花了很多时间来探讨这个问题。她能看到，外在的批评家通常会让她陷入一种非常古老的感觉和信念：“人们是如此不可靠——他们总是让你失望——他们根本不值得信任！”

We then moved into exploring her childhood, looking for clues as to where this belief that people were so untrustworthy began. She closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, and when she opened them tears trickled down her face. “It was Father – Daddy - that incredibly selfish, alcoholic a-hole. Please pardon my French. No matter where I’d hide my baby-sitting money he’d always find it, and come home drunk later, crying about how sorry he was and how he’d never do it again. He’d even let me go off on him! Oh my God, just like poor Frank! Just sit there and take it. Only poor Frank \[more tears\], he’s never done anything like that to me. He’s pretty reliable in most ways, except for not being as organized as me.”

我们接着探索她的童年，寻找这种认为人们如此不可信的信念是从何而来的线索。她闭上眼睛，深吸了几口气，当她睁开眼睛时，泪水沿着脸颊滑落。“是父亲——爸爸——那个极其自私、酗酒的混蛋。请原谅我用这个词。无论我把看护小孩的钱藏在哪里，他总能找到，然后醉醺醺地回家，哭着说他是多么抱歉，他再也不会这样做了。他甚至让我对他发火！哦，我的上帝，就像可怜的弗兰克！只是坐在那里承受。只有可怜的弗兰克\[更多泪水\]，他从来没有对我做过这样的事。他在大多数方面都很可靠，除了没有我这么有组织。”
