\*\*PASSSIVE-AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE OUTER CRITIC

被动攻击性与外在批评\*\*

Children are initially wired to respond angrily to parental abuse or neglect. Outside of the fight types, most traumatized children learn early that protesting parental unfairness is an unpardonable offense. They are generally forced to repress their protests and complaints. This then renders their anger silent and subliminal. This anger however, does not disappear. It percolates as an ever accumulating sea of resentment that can fuel the outer critic’s obsession for finding fault and seeing danger in everyone.

孩子们最初会本能地以愤怒回应父母的虐待或忽视。在战斗类型之外，大多数受创伤的孩子很早就学会，抗议父母的不公平是一种不可饶恕的罪行。他们通常被迫压抑自己的抗议和抱怨。这使他们的愤怒变得无声和潜意识。然而，这种愤怒并没有消失。它像一股不断积累的怨恨之海，可以激发外部批评者寻找过错和看到危险的习惯。

Viewing all relationships through the lens of parental abandonment, the outer critic never lets down its guard. It continuously transfers unexpressed childhood anger onto others, and silently scapegoats them by blowing current disappointments out of proportion. Citing insignificant transgressions as justification, the survivor flashes back into outer critic mode, and silently fumes and grumbles in long judgmental ruminations. To bastardize Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “How do I find thee lacking? Let me count the ways.”

通过父母遗弃的视角看待所有关系，外部批评者永远不会放松警惕。它不断地将未表达出的童年愤怒转移到他人身上，并通过夸大当前的失望来无声地将他们作为替罪羊。以微不足道的违规行为为借口，幸存者会闪回外部批评者的模式，并在长时间的评判性沉思中默默燃烧和抱怨。用伊丽莎白·巴雷特·布朗宁的话来说：“我如何发现你的不足？让我数一数。”

When silently blaming the wrong person becomes habitual, it manifests as _passive-aggressiveness_. Common examples of passive aggression are distancing yourself in hurt withdrawal, or pushing others away with backhanded compliments. Other examples include poor listening, hurtful teasing disguised as joking, and the withholding of positive feedback and appreciation. Chronic lateness and poor follow through on commitments can also be unconscious, passive-aggressive ways of expressing anger to others.

当习惯性地无声地责怪错误的人时，这会表现为被动攻击性。常见的被动攻击例子包括在受伤时疏远自己，或者用反话来推开他人。其他例子包括差的倾听、伪装成玩笑的伤人取乐，以及抑制积极的反馈和赞赏。长期迟到和未能履行承诺也可能是无意识的、表达愤怒给别人的被动攻击方式。
