**INTIMACY AND THE OUTER CRITIC  
  
亲密与外在批评**

As stated earlier, Cptsd typically includes an attachment disorder that comes from the absence of a sympathetic caregiver in childhood. When the developing child lacks a supportive parental refuge, she never learns that other people can soothe loneliness and emotional pain. She never learns that real intimacy grows out of sharing all of her experience.  
  
如前所述，创伤后应激障碍通常包括一种依恋障碍，这种障碍源于儿童时期缺乏一个同情的照顾者。当成长中的孩子缺乏一个支持性的父母避风港时，她从未学会其他人可以抚慰孤独和情感痛苦。她从未学会真正的亲密是通过分享她所有的经历而成长的。

To the degree that our caretakers attack or abandon us for showing vulnerability, to that degree do we later avoid the authentic self-expression that is fundamental to intimacy. The outer critic forms to remind us that everyone else is surely as dangerous as our original caretakers. Subliminal memories of being scorned for seeking our parents’ support then short-circuit our inclinations to share our troubles and ask for help.  
  
在我们照顾者因为表现出脆弱而攻击或抛弃我们的程度，我们后来就会避免那种对亲密关系至关重要的真实自我表达。外在的批评者形成来提醒我们，其他人肯定和我们最初照顾者一样危险。潜意识中因为寻求父母的支持而受到轻蔑的记忆会短路我们分享麻烦和寻求帮助的倾向。

Even worse, retaliation fantasies can plague us for hours and days on the occasions when we do show our vulnerabilities. I once experienced this after being very honest and vulnerable in a job interview with a committee of eight. Over the next three insomnia-plagued nights, my outer critic ran non-stop films featuring my interviewers’ contempt about everything I had said, and disgust about all that I had left out. Even after they subsequently and enthusiastically hired me, the outer critic plagued me with “imposter syndrome” fantasies of eventually being exposed as incompetent in the new job.  
  
甚至更糟糕的是，报复幻想可能会在我们在表现出脆弱的时候困扰我们数小时甚至数天。我曾经在一次与八个委员会成员的面试中非常坦诚和脆弱后经历过这种情况。接下来的三个失眠之夜，我的外在批评家不停地播放着关于我的面试官对我所说的一切都表示轻蔑，对我遗漏的一切都感到厌恶的电影。即使他们随后热情地雇佣了我，外在批评家仍然用“冒牌货综合症”的幻想困扰我，幻想我最终会在新工作中被揭露为不称职。
