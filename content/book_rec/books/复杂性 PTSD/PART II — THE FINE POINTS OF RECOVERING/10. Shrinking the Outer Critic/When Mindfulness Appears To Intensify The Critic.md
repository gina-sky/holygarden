**When Mindfulness Appears To Intensify The Critic  
  
当 mindfulness 似乎加剧了批评者时**

In early recovery the outer critic unfortunately seems to become nastier and stronger the more we challenge it. We may even think we are counter-productively stirring it up or making it worse by daring to resist it.  
  
在早期康复阶段，不幸的是，外界的批评似乎在我们挑战它的时候变得更加恶劣和强大。我们甚至可能认为，我们通过敢于抵制它，反而适得其反地激怒了它或使它变得更糟。

When mindfulness of the critic seems to strengthen it, we are typically flashing back to how our parents rebuked our early protests at their attacks. This is often impossible to remember because [[null|]]our dysfunctional parents typically kill our protest function before our memory function comes on line. Nonetheless, fear of parental reprisal is often the unconscious dynamic that scares us out of challenging our own toxic thinking. This is why survivors in early recovery often need to invoke the instinct of angry self-protection to empower their thought-stopping.  
  
当对批评者的觉察似乎增强了批评者时，我们通常会回想起我们的父母如何在我们早期抗议他们的攻击时斥责我们。这通常是不可能的，因为我们的功能失调的父母通常在我们记忆功能启动之前就扼杀了我们的抗议功能。尽管如此，对父母报复的恐惧往往是一种无意识的动力，使我们不敢挑战自己的有毒思维。这就是为什么在早期康复中的幸存者往往需要唤起愤怒的自我保护本能来赋予他们停止思考的力量。

There is another dynamic occurring when critic-work seems to strengthen rather than weaken the critic. As we become less dissociated, we begin to notice critic processes that were there all along under the horizon of our awareness. Our childhood survival was aided by learning to dissociate from these painful critic processes. Consequently, many of us come into recovery barely able to even notice the critic.  
  
当批评工作似乎增强了而不是削弱批评者时，还有一个动态在发生。随着我们逐渐减少解离，我们开始注意到一直存在于我们意识水平之下的批评过程。我们的童年生存得益于学会从这些痛苦的批评过程中解离。因此，我们许多人进入康复时几乎无法注意到批评者。

Our recovering depends on us using mindfulness to decrease our habits of dissociation. Only then can we see the critic programs that we need to deconstruct, shrink and consciously disidentify from. This typically involves learning to tolerate the pain that comes from discovering how pervasive and strong the critic is. This pain is sometimes a hard pill to swallow because progress in fighting the critic is hard to see at first. And then, even when our shrinking work is effective, progress usually feels disappointingly slow and gradual. This is especially true during a flashback, when the critic can seem to be as strong as ever.  
  
我们的恢复取决于我们利用正念来减少我们的分离习惯。只有在这种情况下，我们才能看到我们需要解构、缩小并自觉与之断绝关系的批评程序。这通常涉及学习忍受因发现批评的普遍性和强度而带来的痛苦。这种痛苦有时很难吞下，因为一开始在对抗批评方面取得的进步很难看到。然后，即使我们的缩小工作有效，进步通常也感觉令人失望地缓慢和渐进。这在闪回期间尤其如此，当批评似乎和以前一样强大。

As stated earlier, the critic grew carcinogenically in childhood. It is like a pervasive cancer that requires many uncomfortable operations to remove. Nonetheless, we can choose to face the acute pain of critic-shrinking work because we want to end the chronic pain of having the critic destroy our enjoyment of life. It is the fight of a lifetime.  
  
如前所述，批评在童年时期像癌细胞一样恶性增长。它就像一种需要许多不舒服的手术来移除的普遍癌症。尽管如此，我们可以选择面对批评缩小工作的剧痛，因为我们想结束批评破坏我们享受生活带来的慢性痛苦。这是一场一生的战斗。
