**Scapegoating  
  
替罪羊**

Scapegoating is an outer critic process whereby personal frustration is unfairly dumped onto others. Scapegoating is typically fuelled by unworked through anger about childhood abandonment. Displacing anger on the wrong target however, fails to release or resolve old or unrelated hurts.  
  
替罪羊是外部批评者的一种过程，即不公平地将个人挫折转嫁给他人。替罪羊通常是由未处理的童年被遗弃的愤怒所驱动的。然而，将愤怒转移到错误的目标上，并不能释放或解决旧伤或无关的伤害。

Scapegoating is often a reenactment of a parent’s abusive role. It is blind imitation of a parent who habitually released his frustration by indiscriminately raging. When a fight type parent scapegoats those around him, he enforces a perverse kind of mirroring. He is making sure that when he feels bad, so does everyone else. It is like a bumper sticker I saw the other day: “If Momma ain’t happy, Nobody’s happy.”  
  
替罪羊通常是对父母虐待角色的重演。这是对父母习惯性地通过无差别地发泄愤怒来释放挫折的无视模仿。当一个喜欢争吵的父母将周围的人视为替罪羊时，他强制实施一种扭曲的镜像。他确保当他感到不快时，其他人也是如此。这就像我前几天看到的一个车贴：“如果妈妈不高兴，就没有人高兴。”

I witnessed this common example of scapegoating several times in my childhood. My parents hated anyone who was late. If one of us children were even a minute late for something, they felt absolutely justified in blasting us with their “righteous” indignation. This was true even though we all learned very quickly to be anally punctual. Because of their untreated Cptsd however, their anger was the tip of the iceberg of their unexpressed rage about their own childhood hurts. In this case, they were flashing back to the pain of [[null|]]their parents’ chronic lateness and failure to show up to meet their normal childhood needs.  
  
我在童年时期目睹了这种常见的替罪羊例子好几次。我的父母讨厌任何迟到的人。如果我们中的任何一个孩子连一分钟都迟到，他们认为用他们的“正义”愤怒来责骂我们是完全有道理的。尽管我们很快就学会了非常守时，但因为他们没有治疗过 Cptsd，他们的愤怒只是他们未表达的对自身童年伤害的愤怒的冰山一角。在这种情况下，他们回到了父母慢性迟到和未能满足他们正常童年需求时的痛苦。
