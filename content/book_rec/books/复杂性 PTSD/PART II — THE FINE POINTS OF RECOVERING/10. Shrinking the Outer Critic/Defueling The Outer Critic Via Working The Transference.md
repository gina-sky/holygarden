\*\*Defueling The Outer Critic Via Working The Transference

通过处理移情来削弱外在批评者\*\*

_Transference_ \[AKA projection; AKA displacement\] occurs when unprocessed feelings from the past amplify present time feelings. [[null|]]A key characteristic of outer critic-dominated flashbacks is that we displace emotional pain from past relationships onto current ones. Transference is the pipeline from the past that supplies the critic with anger to control, attack or disapprove of present relationships.

移情\[又称投射；又称转移\]发生在过去未处理的情感放大了现在的情感时。外在批评者主导的闪回的一个关键特征是我们将过去关系中的情感痛苦转移到当前的关系上。移情是过去向批评者供应愤怒以控制、攻击或反对当前关系的管道。

As a baby thrives on love, so does the outer critic thrive on anger. Like a parasite, the outer critic gorges on repressed anger, and then erroneously assigns it to present-day disappointments.

正如婴儿依赖于爱一样，外在批评者依赖于愤怒。像寄生虫一样，外在批评者饱食压抑的愤怒，然后错误地将它归咎于当下的失望。

The most common transferrential dynamic that I witness occurs when leftover hurt about a parent gets displaced onto someone we perceive as hurting us in the present. When this occurs, we respond to them with a magnified anger or anguish that is out of proportion to what they did.

我观察到的最常见的移情动态发生在我们对父母的剩余伤害被转移到我们认为是伤害我们的人身上时。当这种情况发生时，我们以放大了的愤怒或痛苦回应他们，这种愤怒或痛苦与他们所做的事情不成比例。

Transference can also grossly distort our perceptions, and sometimes we can misperceive a harmless person as being hurtful. Transference can fire up the critic to imagine slights that do not actually occur. Transference typically runs wild when the outer critic is on a rampage.

移情也可能极大地扭曲我们的感知，有时我们可能会误解一个无害的人为有害。移情会激发批评者想象实际上并未发生的不敬。当外在批评者狂暴时，移情通常会很猖獗。

Just as the inner critic transmutes unreleased anger into self-hate, the outer critic uses it to control and /or push others away. Unexpressed and unworked through anger about childhood hurt is a hidden reserve that the critic can always tap into. The anger work of grieving the losses of childhood is so essential because it breaks the critic’s supply line to this anger.

正如内在批评将未释放的愤怒转化为自我仇恨一样，外在批评则用它来控制和/或推开他人。关于童年伤害未表达和未处理的愤怒是一种隐藏的储备，批评者可以随时利用。哀悼童年失去的愤怒工作之所以至关重要，因为它切断了批评者对这种愤怒的供应线。

Grieving out old unexpressed pain about our poor parenting gradually deconstructs the process of transferring it unfairly onto others. This is crucial because love and intimacy are murdered when the critic habitually projects old anger out at an intimate.

逐渐哀悼关于我们糟糕教养的旧未表达痛苦，逐渐破坏了将其不公平地转移到他人身上的过程。这一点至关重要，因为当批评者习惯性地将旧愤怒投射到亲密关系中时，爱和亲密就会被扼杀。
