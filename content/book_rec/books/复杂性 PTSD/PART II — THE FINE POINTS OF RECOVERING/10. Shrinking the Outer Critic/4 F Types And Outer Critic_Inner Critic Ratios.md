\*\*4F TYPES AND OUTER CRITIC/INNER CRITIC RATIOS

4F 类型与外在批评/内在批评比例\*\*

Depending on your 4F type, you may gravitate to either the inner or the outer critic. Different 4F types generally have different ratios of outer and inner critic dynamics, and some polarize extremely to one or the other.

根据你的 4F 类型，你可能倾向于内在批评者或外在批评者。不同的 4F 类型通常具有不同的外在和内在批评动态比例，有些极端地偏向于其中之一。

Freeze and Fight types are often polarized to the outer critic. Fawn types tend to be dominated by the inner critic. Flight types [[null|]]can have the most variance in inner and outer critic ratio. Your subtype can also have a big influence on this.

冻结和战斗类型通常被外部批评者所极端化。鹿类型往往受内部批评者主导。飞行类型在内部和外部批评者比例上可能存在最大差异。你的子类型也会对此有很大影响。

The Freeze type can judgmentally denounce the entire outside world to justify her all-or-none belief that people are dangerous. The Flight type can use his own perfectionistic striving to excel so that his outer critic can judge everyone else as inferior. The Fawn type uses inner critic self-hate to self-censor and avoid the fear of being authentic and vulnerable in relationship. The Fight type, in a paradoxical twist, controls others through the outer critic to prevent them from abandoning him while at the same time using prickliness to not let them get too close.

冻结类型可能会评判性地谴责整个外部世界，以证明她非黑即白的信念，即人们是危险的。飞行类型可以利用自己的完美主义追求来出类拔萃，这样他的外部批评者就可以评判其他人都是低劣的。鹿类型利用内部批评者的自我仇恨来自我审查，避免在关系中表现出真实和脆弱的恐惧。战斗类型，在一种矛盾转折中，通过外部批评者控制他人，防止他们抛弃自己，同时利用尖刻来不让他人过于接近。

Fight types can also leave at the first sign that the other cannot be controlled. One flight-fight type, who I worked with briefly, told me with great upset about a recent betrayal. His new partner “insisted” on replacing the empty toilet paper roll so that the new roll unwound from the bottom instead of the top. He asked her once to do it his way and felt so betrayed when she did not comply, that he broke up with her. I could not help feeling that she was fortunate that she got away.

战斗类型也可以在对方无法被控制的第一迹象时离开。一位我曾短暂合作过的战斗-逃跑型人告诉我，他最近遭遇了背叛。他的新搭档“坚持”要更换空掉的卫生纸卷，让新卷从底部卷起而不是顶部。他要求她按照他的方式做一次，当她没有照做时，他感到非常背叛，于是与她分手了。我不禁觉得她能逃脱是幸运的。

Unfortunately, this client was not able to take in that the lion’s share of his upset was a flashback. He had flashed back to his rigidly controlling mother frightening him into believing that the toilet paper must unwind from the top. She had punished him into believing that this was a universal truth. Perfectionism, in the hands of the outer critic, can be paranoiacally picayune.

不幸的是，这位客户无法意识到他大部分的愤怒是一种闪回。他回想起他的严格控制的母亲恐吓他，让他相信卫生纸必须从顶部卷起。她惩罚他，让他相信这是普遍真理。在外在批评者的手中，完美主义可能会变得偏执而琐碎。

Finally it is not unusual for survivors, who have significantly shrunk their dominant critic mode, to experience a reciprocal increase in the virulence of its opposite counterpart. This came as a disappointing shock to me at a time when I was congratulating myself that my inner critic was a mere shadow of its former self. Soon [[null|]]thereafter, I noticed that I was plagued by a new judgmentalness that seemed out of character. Curiosity and a growing mindfulness about this development lead me to a lot of the insights that I share in this chapter. With enough mindfulness, this shift in critic mode can then become an opportunity to further shrink the overall combined agency of the outer and inner critic.

最后，对于那些显著减少了其主导批评模式的幸存者来说，他们可能会经历其对立面的攻击性增加，这对我来说是一个令人失望的震惊。在我自我庆幸我的内心批评只是其过去的影子时，这种情况发生了。不久之后，我发现我受到了一种似乎与我的性格不符的新评判性的困扰。对这种发展的好奇心和日益增长的觉察力引导我获得了许多我在本章中分享的洞见。有了足够的觉察力，这种批评模式的变化就可以成为进一步缩小外在和内在批评总体影响力的机会。
