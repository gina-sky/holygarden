\*\*Grieving Resolves Flashback \[Step # 9\]

哀悼解决闪回\[步骤 #9\]\*\*

Returning to the above vignette, I wondered out loud to my client, “Do you think you might be in a flashback?” Because of the numerous times we had previously identified her emotional upsets as flashbacks, she immediately recognized this and let go into deep sobbing. She dropped into profound grieving.

回到上述案例，我大声对我的客户说：“你认为你可能处于闪回中吗？”由于我们之前多次将她情绪上的困扰识别为闪回，她立刻认出了这一点，并放声大哭。她陷入了深深的哀悼之中。

[[null|]]Her crying combined tears of relief with tears of grief. Her tears of relief came from being able to take in my empathy. Her tears of grief were the feelings of her abject childhood pain being released. Her tears of relief also came from once again remembering the source of this previously confusing and overwhelming pain.

她的哭泣结合了释然的泪水和悲伤的泪。她的释然之泪来自于能够感受到我的同情。她的悲伤之泪是她那不堪回首的童年痛苦得以释放的感觉。她的释然之泪也来自于再次记起这种先前令人困惑和压倒性的痛苦的根源。

My client continued to cry and released more of the pain of her original trauma. Further tears were about being stuck so often in flashbacks. As her tears subsided, she recalled a time as a small child when she literally received a single lump of coal in her Christmas stocking. Mean mom had “scrooged” her as punishment for being ten minutes late to dinner. Her tears then morphed into healthy anger about this abuse, and she felt herself returning to an empowered sense of self. Grieving brought her back into the present and broke the amnesia of the flashback.

我的客户继续哭泣，释放了她原始创伤的更多痛苦。更多的泪水是因为她经常陷入闪回。随着她的泪水平息，她回想起小时候的一个时候，她圣诞袜里只收到一块煤。妈妈因为她晚到晚餐十分钟而“吝啬”地惩罚了她。她的泪水随后变成了对这种虐待的健康的愤怒，她感觉自己回到了一个有力量感的自我。悲伤让她回到了当下，打破了闪回的失忆。

She then remembered to invoke her instinct of self-protection. We had gradually been rebuilding it with role-plays and assertiveness training. She angrily vented about her parents’ destruction of her right to defend herself against abuse and unfairness. She started cheekily chanting “That’s not fair!” as if to show her parents they could no longer attack her for saying it.

然后她想起了要调用她的自我保护本能。我们通过角色扮演和自信训练逐渐重建了它。她愤怒地发泄了她父母破坏她自卫权、对抗虐待和不公平的行为。她开始调皮地念叨“这不公平！”好像在向父母展示，他们不能再因为她这么说而攻击她了。

She then moved further into reiterating her right to have boundaries. She mocked mom and dad as poor excuses for parents. And then she turned her anger onto the critic with a resounding refrain of saying “no”. “No, you cannot judge me. No, you cannot pick me apart anymore. No you cannot waste my time with all your stupid worries!”

她随后进一步重申了自己拥有界限的权利。她嘲讽父母是糟糕的父母。然后，她将愤怒转向了批评者，反复地说“不”。“不，你不能评判我。不，你不能再拆穿我了。不，你不能用你所有的愚蠢担忧浪费我的时间！”

Finally, I reminded her to reinvoke her sense of safety by recognizing that she now inhabited an adult body. She was now free of parental control. She had many resources to draw on: intelligence, strength, resilience, and a growing sense of community. She lived in a safe home. She had the support of her therapist and two friends who were her allies and who readily saw her essential worth.

最后，我提醒她通过认识到自己现在拥有成人身体来重新唤起她的安全感。她现在摆脱了父母的控制。她可以调动许多资源：智慧、力量、韧性和日益增长的社会感。她生活在一个安全的家庭中。她得到了治疗师和两位朋友的支持，他们是她的盟友，并且乐于看到她本质的价值。

[[null|]]I also observed that she was making ongoing progress in managing her flashbacks which were occurring less often and less intensely.

我还观察到她在管理闪回方面取得了持续进步，闪回发生的频率和强度都在降低。

After about forty minutes, she was released from the flashback. I have witnessed this restorative power of grieving on innumerable occasions. The intricacies of therapeutic grieving will be explored in [[11. Grieving|chapter 11]].

大约四十分钟后，她从闪回中解脱出来。我见证过无数次这种哀悼的恢复力量。治疗性哀悼的复杂性将在第 11 章中探讨。
