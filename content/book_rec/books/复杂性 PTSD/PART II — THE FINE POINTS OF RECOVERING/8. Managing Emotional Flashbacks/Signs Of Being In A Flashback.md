**Signs Of Being In A Flashback  
  
闪回的迹象**

We can often find ourselves in a flashback without ever having seen the “flash.” There are a variety of clues that we can learn to identify as signs that we are caught in a flashback. This is essential to recovery, as naming our experience “flashback” \[step#1 in flashback management\] often immediately brings some relief. Even more importantly, it points us in the direction of working the other 12 steps of flashback management.  
  
我们常常发现自己处于闪回中，却从未真正看到“闪回”。有许多线索，我们可以学会识别，作为我们陷入闪回的迹象。这对于康复至关重要，因为将我们的经历称为“闪回”（闪回管理中的第 1 步）通常会立即带来一些缓解。更重要的是，它指引我们朝着完成闪回管理的其他 12 个步骤的方向前进。

One common sign of being flashed-back is that we feel small, helpless, and hopeless. In intense flashbacks this magnifies into [[null|]]feeling so ashamed that we are loath to go out or show our face anywhere. Feeling fragile, on edge, delicate and easily crushable is another aspect of this. The survivor may also notice an evaporation of whatever self-esteem he has earned since he left home. This is a flashback to the childhood years where implicit family rules forbade any self-esteem at all.  
  
一种常见的闪回迹象是我们感到渺小、无助和绝望。在强烈的闪回中，这种感觉会加剧，以至于我们不愿意外出或在任何地方露面。感到脆弱、紧张、脆弱且易受伤害是这一方面的另一个方面。幸存者还可能注意到，自从他离开家以来，他获得的所有自尊都消失了。这是对童年岁月的闪回，那时隐含的家庭规则禁止有任何自尊。

Another common clue that we are flashing back is an increase in the virulence of the inner or outer critic. This typically looks like increased drasticizing and catastrophizing, as well as intensified self-criticism or judgmentalness of others. A very common example of this is lapsing into extremely polarized, all-or-none thinking such as only being able to see what is wrong with yourself and/or others.  
  
我们正在闪回的另一个常见线索是内心或外在批评的恶意增加。这通常表现为加剧的极端化和灾难化，以及自我批评或对他人的评判性加强。一个非常常见的例子是陷入极端的两极化、非黑即白的思想，比如只能看到自己或他人身上的错误。

In my own mid-level recovery, I learned that when I was feeling especially judgmental of others, it usually meant that I had flashed back to being around my critical parents. The trigger was usually that some vulnerability of mine was in ascendancy. In response, I then over-noticed others’ faults so that I could justify avoiding them and the embarrassment of being seen in a state of not being shiny enough.  
  
在我自己的中级恢复过程中，我了解到，当我特别评判他人时，通常意味着我回到了与批评性父母相处的时光。触发因素通常是我的一些脆弱之处变得突出。作为回应，我就会过度关注他人的过错，以便为自己避免他们和被看到不够光鲜的状态提供借口。

Another clue that we are in a flashback occurs when we notice that our emotional reactions are out of proportion to what has triggered them. Here are two common instances of this: \[1\] a minor upset feels like an emergency; \[2\] a minor unfairness feels like a travesty of justice.  
  
当我们注意到我们的情绪反应与触发它们的因素不成比例时，这也是我们处于闪回状态的另一个线索。这里有这种情况的两个常见例子：\[1\] 小小的烦恼感觉像紧急情况；\[2\] 小小的不公平感觉像司法的丑闻。

In the first instance, you drop a book that you are carrying and launch into an angry, self-berating tirade that lingers for hours. In the second instance, another driver’s relatively harmless, un-signaled lane change triggers you into rageful indignation that reverberates in your psyche for hours.  
  
在第一种情况下，你可能会因为不小心掉落手中的书而爆发愤怒和自我谴责的咒骂，这种情绪会持续数小时。在第二种情况下，另一位司机的相对无害且未打信号的变道可能会触发你愤怒的义愤，这种情绪会在你的心理中持续数小时。

When we are not mindful at such times, we can erupt against ourselves in self-disgust and self-hatred, or we can unfairly explode out against the relatively innocent other.  
  
在这些时候，如果我们没有保持警觉，我们可能会对自己产生自我厌恶和自我仇恨，或者我们可能会不公平地爆发对相对无辜的他人。

[[null|]]On the other hand, we can choose healthy flashback management once we recognize these examples as flashbacks to the real emergencies and injustices of our childhood. Furthermore, we can harvest recovery out of these unpleasant flashbacks by seeing them as proof that we were traumatized. When we do the latter, we can morph our anger into healthy indignation about the outrageously unfair conditions of our upbringing.  
  
另一方面，一旦我们认识到这些例子是童年真实紧急情况和不公正的闪回，我们就可以选择健康的闪回管理。此外，我们可以通过将这些不愉快的闪回视为我们受到创伤的证据来从中收获恢复。当我们这样做时，我们可以将我们的愤怒转化为对我们成长过程中极端不公平条件的健康义愤。
