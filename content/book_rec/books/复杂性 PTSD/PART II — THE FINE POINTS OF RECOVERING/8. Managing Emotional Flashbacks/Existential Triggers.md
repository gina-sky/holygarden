存在性触发\*\*

Many psychologists use the term _existential_ to describe the fact that all human beings are subject to painful events. These are normal recurring afflictions that everyone suffers from time to time. Horrible world events, difficult choices, illnesses and periodic feelings of abject loneliness are common examples of existential pain. Existential calamities can be especially triggering for survivors, because we typically have so much family-of-origin calamity for them to trigger us into reliving.

许多心理学家使用“存在性”一词来描述这样一个事实：所有人类都受痛苦事件的困扰。这些是正常反复出现的折磨，每个人都会时不时地遭受。可怕的世界事件、艰难的选择、疾病和周期性的极度孤独都是存在性痛苦的常见例子。存在性灾难对幸存者来说可能特别具有触发作用，因为我们通常有如此多的原生家庭灾难，它们会触发我们重新经历。

Another particularly triggering existential phenomenon is the fact that we all suffer invisible, unpredictable mood shifts. Good moods sometimes inexplicably deteriorate into bad ones. As novelist, David Mitchell wrote “Good moods are as fragile as eggs… and bad moods as fragile as bricks”.

另一个特别触动人性的存在主义现象是我们都承受着无形、不可预测的情绪波动。好心情有时会莫名其妙地转变为坏心情。小说家大卫·米切尔写道：“好心情像鸡蛋一样脆弱……而坏心情像砖块一样脆弱”。

This is usually because you were punished or abandoned in the past for showing your full complement of feelings. So now, out of old habit, you automatically dissociate when your emotional weather is inclement.

在创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）中，情绪波动的不可预测性通常是个问题。这些波动可以迅速触发你进入完全的闪回。这通常是因为你在过去因为表现出全部的情感而受到惩罚或被遗弃。所以现在，出于旧习惯，当你的情绪天气恶劣时，你会自动地解离。

The inner child often experiences this as you reverting to the pre-recovery adult who had no time for feelings. The child then feels that he is once again trapped in the past where he was so devastatingly abandoned. Perhaps, the resultant flashback is his only way to really get your attention. This is, again, why I try to make my default position turning to myself and my inner child with unconditional positive regard as much as possible.

内心的小孩经常会经历这种回到未康复的成年人的状态，这个成年人没有时间去感受情绪。然后孩子会觉得自己再次被困在过去，那里他被无情地遗弃。也许，随之而来的闪回是他真正引起你注意的唯一方式。这也是为什么我尽可能地采取默认立场，转向我自己和我的内心小孩，并以无条件积极关注对待他们。
