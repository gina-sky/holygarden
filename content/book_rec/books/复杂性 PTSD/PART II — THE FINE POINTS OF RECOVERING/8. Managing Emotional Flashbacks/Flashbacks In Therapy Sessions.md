\*\*Flashbacks In Therapy Sessions

治疗过程中的闪回\*\*

This section is for survivors who are in therapy or contemplating starting it. Over the years, I have noticed that as survivors feel safe enough with me, opportunities arise more frequently for working with flashbacks during sessions. Sometimes it even seems that some part of them “schedules” their flashbacks to occur just prior to or during our session. It is as if they are looking for “on the job [[null|]]training” in flashback management. Some therapists describe this as regression in the service of building the healthy ego.

本节是为正在接受治疗或考虑开始治疗的幸存者准备的。多年来，我注意到，随着幸存者对我感到足够安全，在治疗过程中处理闪回的机会会变得更加频繁。有时甚至感觉他们的一部分“安排”闪回发生在我们的会话之前或期间。这就像他们正在寻找关于闪回管理的“在职培训”。一些治疗师将这描述为为了建立健康的自我而进行的回归。

I recently experienced this with a client who rushed into my office five minutes late, visibly flushed and anxious. She opened the session by exclaiming: “I’m such a loser. I can’t do anything right. You must be sick of working with me.” This was someone who had, on previous occasions, been moved by my validation of her ongoing accomplishments in our work.

最近，我遇到一位客户，她迟到了五分钟冲进我的办公室，脸色红润，显得很焦虑。她一开场就大声说道：“我真是太失败了。我什么也做不好。你肯定对我感到厌烦了。”这位客户以前在我们的工作中取得的成绩得到我的认可时，总是很感动。

Based on what she had uncovered about her mother’s punitive perfectionism in previous sessions, I was certain that being late had triggered her into an emotional flashback. In this moment, she was experiencing right-brain emotional dominance and a decrease in left-brain rational thinking. As so often happens in a flashback, she temporarily lost access to her post-childhood knowledge and understanding. This appears to be a mechanism of dissociation, and in this instance, it rendered my client amnesiac of my high regard for our work together.

根据她在之前的会话中揭露的母亲严厉的完美主义，我确信迟到触发了她的情绪闪回。在这个时刻，她正经历着右脑情感主导和左脑理性思考的减少。正如在闪回中经常发生的那样，她暂时失去了对童年之后知识和理解的访问。这似乎是一种解离机制，在这个例子中，它使我的客户忘记了我们对工作的共同高度评价。

I believe this type of dissociation also accounts for the recurring disappearance of previously established trust that commonly occurs with emotional flashbacks. As we progress in our recovery, we learn that flashbacks can cause us to forget that our proven allies are in fact still reliable. With enough practice, however, we can learn to interpret feelings of distrust with proven friends as evidence that we are in a flashback. We are flashing back to our childhoods when no one was trustworthy.

我相信这种解离也解释了情感闪回中常见的先前建立的信任反复消失的现象。随着我们康复的进展，我们了解到闪回会让我们忘记我们确信的盟友实际上仍然可靠。然而，经过足够的练习，我们可以学会将对证明朋友的不信任感视为我们处于闪回的证据。我们回到了童年时期，那时没有人是值得信赖的。
