**Later Stage Recovery  
  
后期康复阶段**

When your recovery matures sufficiently, you realize that much of the emotional pain of your flashbacks is appropriate but delayed reactions to your childhood abuse and neglect. You process your feelings in a way that resolves flashbacks, and also builds an increasingly healthy, sense of self.  
  
当你的恢复足够成熟时，你会意识到你许多闪回中的情感痛苦是适当的但延迟的反应，是对你童年虐待和忽视的反应。你以处理你的感觉的方式解决闪回，同时也建立了一个越来越健康的自我感。

This, in turn, leads to an ongoing reduction of the unresolved childhood pain that fuels your emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks then become less frequent, intense and enduring. Eventually, you learn to invoke your self-protective instinct as soon as you realize that you are triggered. As flashbacks decrease and become more manageable, the defensive structures built around them (narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, dissociative and/or codependent) are more readily deconstructed.  
  
这反过来导致未解决的童年痛苦持续减少，这些痛苦是激发你情绪闪回的燃料。然后，闪回变得不那么频繁、强烈和持久。最终，当你意识到自己被触发时，你学会立即唤起自我保护的本能。随着闪回的减少和更容易管理，围绕它们建立的防御结构（自恋、强迫性、解离性和/或共生性）更容易被拆解。

At this stage of your recovery, you may now experience an ironically satisfying experience when you come out of a flashback. You may sense on many levels of your awareness that life as a child in your parents’ house was even worse than you realized. Simultaneously, [[null|]]you may feel a corresponding sense of relief that you are now freer from your parents’ life-spoiling influence than ever before.  
  
在这个恢复阶段，当你从闪回中出来时，你可能会体验到一种讽刺的满足感。你可能会在意识的多层面上感觉到，在你父母家中作为孩子的日子比你意识到的还要糟糕。同时，你也可能会感到一种相应的解脱感，因为你现在比以往任何时候都更加自由，摆脱了父母对生活的破坏性影响。
