Another clue about being in a flashback is an increased use of primitive self-soothing techniques. Many survivors learn early in life to manage their painful feelings with food, distracting activities or mood-altering substances. Over time self-medication can become habitual and devolve into substance or process addictions.  
  
另一个关于处于闪回状态的证据是原始自我安抚技巧的使用增加。许多幸存者在早年就学会了用食物、分散注意力的活动或改变情绪的物质来管理他们的痛苦感受。随着时间的推移，自我治疗可能会变成习惯，并演变成物质或过程上的依赖。

With self-medication, I believe there is a continuum of severity that stretches from occasional use on one end to true addiction on the other. For many survivors, self-medication is a matter of degree. An especially strong urge to use more substance or process than normal is a powerful clue that you are in a flashback. With practice, mindfully noticing a sudden upsurge in craving can be interpreted as the need to invoke the flashback management steps. Moreover, I see many survivors gradually decrease their self-medicating habits by effectively using these steps.  
  
自我用药，我认为其严重程度从一端偶尔使用到另一端的真实成瘾之间存在一个连续体。对于许多幸存者来说，自我用药是一个程度问题。特别强烈的欲望使用比平时更多的物质或过程是一个强有力的线索，表明你正处于闪回状态。通过练习，有意识地注意到突然的渴望增加可以解释为需要采取闪回管理步骤。此外，我发现许多幸存者通过有效使用这些步骤逐渐减少自我用药的习惯。
