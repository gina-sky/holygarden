MANAGING EMOTIONAL FLASHBACKS  
  
管理情绪闪回

Emotional flashbacks are intensely disturbing regressions \[“amygdala hijackings”\] to the overwhelming feeling-states of your childhood abandonment. When you are stuck in a flashback, fear, shame and/or depression can dominate your experience.  
  
情绪闪回是一种强烈的回归，\[“杏仁核劫持”\]让你回到童年被遗弃时的那种压倒性的情感状态。当你陷入闪回时，恐惧、羞愧和/或抑郁可能会主导你的体验。

These are some common experiences of being in an emotional flashback. You feel little, fragile and helpless. Everything feels too hard. Life is too scary. Being seen feels excruciatingly vulnerable. Your battery seems to be dead. In the worst flashbacks an apocalypse feels like it will imminently be upon you.  
  
以下是一些在情绪闪回中的常见体验。你感到自己很小、脆弱和无助。一切感觉都太难了。生活太可怕了。被人看到让你感到极度脆弱。你的电量似乎耗尽了。在最糟糕的闪回中，末日似乎即将降临。

When you are trapped in a flashback, you are reliving the worst emotional times of you childhood. Everything feels overwhelming and confusing, especially because there are rarely any visual components to a Cptsd flashback. This is because, as Goleman’s work shows, _amygdala hijackings_ are intense reactions in the emotional [[null|]]memory part of the brain that override the rational brain. These reactions occur in the brains of people who have been triggered into a 4F reaction so often, that minor events can now trigger them into a panicky state.  
  
当你被困在闪回中时，你正在重温童年最糟糕的情感时刻。一切感觉都压倒性和混乱，尤其是因为 Cptsd 闪回很少包含视觉成分。这是因为，正如戈尔曼的研究所示，杏仁核劫持是大脑情感记忆部分中强烈的反应，它超越了理性大脑。这些反应发生在那些经常被触发进入 4F 反应的人的大脑中，以至于现在小事也能触发他们进入恐慌状态。

**13 Steps for Managing Emotional Flashbacks  
  
管理情绪闪回的 13 个步骤**

\[Focus on Bold Print when flashback is active\]  
  
\[当闪回活跃时，请关注粗体字\]

1.  **Say to yourself: “I am having a flashback”.** Flashbacks take you into a timeless part of the psyche that feels as helpless, hopeless and surrounded by danger as you were in childhood. The feelings and sensations you are experiencing are past memories that cannot hurt you now.  
      
    对自己说：“我正在经历闪回”。闪回将你带入一个无时间感的心理部分，那里让你感到无助、绝望，并被危险包围，就像你童年时一样。你所经历的感受和感觉是过去的记忆，现在不会伤害到你。
2.  **Remind yourself: “I feel afraid but I am not in danger!** I am safe now, here in the present.” Remember you are now in the safety of the present, far from the danger of the past.  
      
    提醒自己：“我感到害怕，但我并不处于危险之中！我现在很安全，就在这里，在当下。”记住你现在身处当下的安全之中，远离过去的危险。
3.  **Own your right/need to have boundaries**. Remind yourself that you do not have to allow anyone to mistreat you; you are free to leave dangerous situations and protest unfair behavior.  
      
    拥有自己的权利/需求，设定界限。提醒自己，你不必允许任何人对你进行虐待；你有权离开危险的情况，抗议不公平的行为。
4.  **Speak reassuringly to the Inner Child**. The child needs to know that you love her/him unconditionally– that s/he can come to you for comfort and protection when s/he feels lost and scared.  
      
    以安抚的语气与内在小孩对话。这个孩子需要知道你无条件地爱她/他——当她/他感到迷茫和害怕时，可以向你寻求安慰和保护。
5.  **Deconstruct eternity thinking.** In childhood, fear and abandonment felt endless – a safer future was unimaginable. Remember this flashback will pass as it always has before.  
      
    分解永恒的思考。在童年时，恐惧和被遗弃的感觉是永恒的——一个更安全的未来是无法想象的。记住，这个闪回会像以前一样过去。
6.  [[null|]]**Remind yourself that you are in an adult body** with allies, skills and resources to protect you that you never had as a child. \[Feeling small and fragile is a sign of a flashback.\]  
      
    提醒自己，你现在拥有一个成人的身体，有盟友、技能和资源来保护你，这些你小时候从未有过。\[感到渺小和脆弱是闪回的迹象。\]
7.  **Ease back into your body**. Fear launches you into “heady” worrying, or numbing and spacing out.  
      
    慢慢回到你的身体中。恐惧让你陷入“狂热的”担忧，或者麻木和分心。
    
    \[a\] **Gently ask your body to Relax**: feel each of your major muscle groups and softly encourage them to relax. \[Tightened muscles send false danger signals to your brain.\]  
      
    \[a\] 轻轻地让你的身体放松：感受你每个主要肌肉群，并温柔地鼓励它们放松。\[紧绷的肌肉会向你的大脑发送虚假的危险信号。\]
    
    \[b\] **Breathe deeply and slowly**. \[Holding your breath also signals danger.\]  
      
    \[b\] 深深地、慢慢地呼吸。\[屏住呼吸也会发出危险的信号。\]
    
    \[c\] **Slow down**: rushing presses your brain’s flight response button.  
      
    \[c\] 慢下来：匆忙会按下你大脑的逃跑反应按钮。
    
    \[d\] **Find a safe place** to unwind and soothe yourself: wrap yourself in a blanket, hold a pillow or a stuffed animal, lie down on your bed or in a closet or in a bath; take a nap.  
      
    \[d\] 找一个安全的地方放松和安抚自己：用毯子把自己裹起来，抱一个枕头或毛绒玩具，躺在床上或在衣柜里，或在浴缸里；小睡一会儿。
    
    \[e\] **Feel the fear in your body without reacting to it**. Fear is just an energy in your body. It cannot hurt you if you do not run from it.  
      
    \[e\] 感受身体中的恐惧，但不要对它做出反应。恐惧只是你身体中的能量。如果你不逃避它，它就不能伤害你。
    
8.  **Resist the Inner Critic’s Drasticizing and Catastrophizing**.  
      
    抵制内心批评者的夸大和灾难化。
    
    \[a\] **Use Thought-stopping** to halt the critic’s endless exaggerations of danger, and its constant planning to control the uncontrollable. Refuse to shame, hate or abandon yourself. Channel the anger of self- attack into saying “NO” to your critic’s unfair self-criticism.  
      
    \[a\] 使用“思维停止”来阻止批评家对危险的无限夸张，以及它对不可控事物的不断计划。拒绝羞辱、憎恨或放弃自己。将自我攻击的愤怒转化为对批评家不公平自我批评说“不”。
    
    \[b\] **Use Thought-substitution & Thought-correction** to replace negative thinking with a memorized list of your qualities and accomplishments.  
      
    \[b\] 使用“思维替代”和“思维纠正”来用你记住的品质和成就列表替换消极思维。
    
9.  **Allow yourself to grieve**. Flashbacks are opportunities to release old, unexpressed feelings of fear, hurt, and abandonment. Validate and soothe your child’s past experience of helplessness and hopelessness. Healthy grieving can [[null|]]turn your tears into self-compassion and your anger into self-protection.  
      
    允许自己哀悼。闪回是释放旧有、未表达过的恐惧、伤害和被遗弃感的机会。验证和安抚孩子过去无助和绝望的经历。健康的哀悼可以将你的泪水转化为自我同情，将你的愤怒转化为自我保护。
10.  **Cultivate safe relationships and seek support**. Take time alone when you need it, but don’t let shame isolate you. Feeling shame doesn’t mean you are shameful. Educate your intimates about flashbacks and ask them to help you talk and feel your way through them.  
      
    培养安全的关系并寻求支持。当你需要独处时，请给自己时间，但不要让羞耻感孤立你。感到羞耻并不意味着你就是可耻的。教育你的亲密关系，并请他们帮助你谈论和感受这些闪回。
11.  **Learn to identify the types of triggers that lead to flashbacks**. Avoid unsafe people, places, activities and triggering mental processes. Practice preventive maintenance with these steps when triggering situations are unavoidable.  
      
    学习识别导致闪回的类型。避免不安全的人、地方、活动和触发心理过程。当无法避免触发情况时，请按照这些步骤进行预防性维护。
12.  **Figure out what you are flashing back to.** Flashbacks are opportunities to discover, validate and heal your wounds from past abuse and abandonment. They also point to your still unmet developmental needs and can provide you with motivation to get them met.  
      
    弄清楚你正在闪回到什么。闪回是发现、验证和治愈过去虐待和遗弃留下的创伤的机会。它们还指向你尚未满足的发展需求，并可以为你提供满足这些需求的动力。
13.  **Be patient with a slow recovery process**. It takes time in the present to become de-adrenalized, and considerable time in the future to gradually decrease the intensity, duration and frequency of flashbacks. Real recovery is a gradually progressive process \[often two steps forward, one step back\], not an attained salvation fantasy. Don’t beat yourself up for having a flashback.  
      
    对缓慢的恢复过程保持耐心。在当下需要时间来去肾上腺素，在未来需要相当长的时间来逐渐减少闪回的强度、持续时间和频率。真正的恢复是一个逐渐进步的过程\[通常是两步前进，一步后退\]，而不是一种达到救赎幻想的状态。不要因为闪回而自责。
