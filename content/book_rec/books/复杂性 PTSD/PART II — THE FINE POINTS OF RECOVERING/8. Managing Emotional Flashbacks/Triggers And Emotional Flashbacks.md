**Triggers And Emotional Flashbacks  
  
触发器和情感闪回**

A trigger is an external or internal stimulus that activates us into an emotional flashback. This often occurs on a subliminal level outside [[null|]]the boundaries of normal consciousness. Recognizing what triggers us can therefore be difficult. Nonetheless, becoming increasingly mindful of our triggers is crucial because it sometimes allows us to avoid flashback-inducing people, situations and behaviors.  
  
触发器是一种外部或内部刺激，能激活我们产生情感闪回。这种情况通常发生在潜意识层面，超出了正常意识的边界。因此，识别出触发我们的因素可能很困难。然而，越来越关注我们的触发因素至关重要，因为它有时能让我们避免引发闪回的人、情境和行为。

External triggers are people, places, things, events, facial expressions, styles of communication, etc., that remind us of our original trauma in a way that flashes us back into the painful feelings of those times. Here are some examples of powerful and common triggers: revisiting your parents; seeing someone who resembles a childhood abuser; experiencing the anniversary of an especially traumatic event; hearing someone use a parent’s shaming tone of voice or turn of phrase.  
  
外部触发器是那些以某种方式让我们回忆起原始创伤的人、地点、事物、事件、面部表情、沟通方式等，它们能让我们回到那些痛苦感受的时刻。以下是一些强大且常见的触发器示例：回到父母身边；看到与童年施暴者相似的人；经历特别创伤事件的周年纪念日；听到有人用父母羞辱的语气或说话方式。

Many triggers however are not so explicit. Sometimes all unknown adults can trigger us into fear even when there is no resemblance to our original abuser\[s\]. I still occasionally feel triggered when I come across a group of teenagers, because I grew up in a neighborhood where there were many violent ones. For this reason, my son who is quite empathic joked that he will not become a teenager when he grows up.  
  
然而，许多触发因素并不那么明显。有时，即使与我们的原初施虐者没有任何相似之处，未知的大人也可能让我们感到恐惧。我仍然偶尔会在看到一群青少年时感到触发，因为我成长在一个有很多暴力行为的社区。因此，我相当有同理心的儿子开玩笑说，他长大后不会成为青少年。

Sometimes someone looking at us, or even noticing us, can trigger us into fear and toxic shame. One of my clients once came in intensely triggered because a cat was staring at him. Other common triggers include making a mistake, asking for help, or having to speak in front of a group of people. Moreover, simply feeling tired, sick, lonely or hungry can sometimes trigger a flashback. Any type of physical pain can also be a trigger.  
  
有时，有人看着我们，甚至注意到我们，都可能让我们感到恐惧和有毒的羞愧。我的一个客户曾经因为一只猫盯着他而极度触发。其他常见的触发因素包括犯错、寻求帮助或需要在众人面前发言。此外，仅仅感到疲倦、生病、孤独或饥饿有时也会触发闪回。任何类型的身体疼痛也可能成为触发因素。

For many survivors, authority figures are the ultimate triggers. I have known several survivors, who have never gotten so much as a parking ticket, who cringe in anxiety whenever they come across a policeman or a police car.  
  
对于许多幸存者来说，权威人物是最终的触发因素。我认识几位幸存者，他们从未收到过停车罚单，但每当他们遇到警察或警车时，都会感到焦虑不安。

It took me decades to overcome my intense performance anxiety about teaching. Nothing could trigger me more than an upcoming teaching engagement. Fortunately I was unwilling to give up [[null|]]this activity, because I enjoyed it most of the time once I got going. I did not make any real progress, beyond learning to “white-knuckle it,” until I recognized my performance anxiety as a flashback to the danger of talking at family dinner time. This recognition allowed me to see that I was unconsciously terrified that my parents were going to show up and scoff at me in public.  
  
我花了数十年的时间才克服对教学强烈的表演焦虑。没有什么能比我即将进行的教学活动更让我紧张的了。幸运的是，我不愿意放弃这项活动，因为一旦开始，我大多数时候都很享受。直到我意识到我的表演焦虑是回到家庭晚餐时说话的危险的闪回，我都没有取得任何真正的进步，除了学会“紧握白牙”。这种认识让我看到，我潜意识里害怕的是我的父母会出现在公共场合并嘲笑我。

At first, I \[my critic\] labeled this a preposterous idea, but when I started to imagine and practice aggressively defending myself against them on the drive to my teaching engagement, I soon experienced an enormous reduction in my anxiety. This experience lead to me formulating Step 6 in the flashback management steps above, as well as my ideas about angering against the critic, which will be explored in the [[9. Shrinking the Inner Critic|next chapter]].  
  
一开始，我把这个想法称为荒谬，但当我开始想象并在前往教学活动的路上积极防御这些想法时，我的焦虑很快得到了极大的缓解。这次经历促使我形成了上述闪回管理步骤中的第 6 步，以及我对对抗批评者的想法，这些内容将在下一章中探讨。
