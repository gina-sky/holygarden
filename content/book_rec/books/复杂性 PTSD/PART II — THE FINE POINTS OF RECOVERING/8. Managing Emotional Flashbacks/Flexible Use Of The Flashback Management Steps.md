**Flexible Use Of The Flashback Management Steps  
  
灵活运用闪回管理步骤**

Helen started her session in a deep state of self-alienation: “I am just such a hopeless case! For no reason at all, I got myself stuck in a terrible flashback yesterday. And it wasn’t one of those impossible-to-figure-out, waking up-flashbacks you keep telling me about. I was fine all morning, and then Bam! I was in it up to here, and there wasn’t any stupid trigger. Nothing caused it. It’s just me. Hopelessly screwed up! Mentally defective!”  
  
海伦开始她的疗程时处于一种深深的自我疏离状态：“我就是这样一个无望的案例！没有任何原因，我昨天陷入了一个可怕的闪回。而且它不是你一直告诉我的那种难以理解的、醒来的闪回。我整个上午都很好，然后砰！我就陷入了其中，没有任何愚蠢的触发因素。没有任何事情导致它。全是我自己。彻底搞砸了！精神有缺陷！”

Discerning the trigger of a flashback is a slippery slope. Seeing the trigger can often rescue us from blaming and hating ourselves [[null|]]for the flashback, but there is not always an identifiable trigger. In such situations, looking for the trigger can quickly deteriorate into self-pathologizing vivisection. This slippery slope can quickly become a cliff as we plummet deeper into the abyss of the flashback.  
  
辨别闪回的触发因素是一条滑稽的道路。看到触发因素往往能让我们从责怪和恨自己的闪回中解脱出来，但并非总有一个可识别的触发因素。在这种情况下，寻找触发因素可能会迅速恶化成自我病理化的解剖。这条滑稽的道路很快就会变成悬崖，我们就会更深地陷入闪回的深渊。

It is almost always a matter of perspective. Am I trigger-searching from a place of being on my side or a place of fault-finding? When it is the latter, it is best to abandon the search and move toward invoking self-acceptance, as there will always be triggerings that are unfathomable. The process of self-support needs to trump the healthy urge to “figure it ALL out” at such times.  
  
这几乎总是关于视角的问题。我是从支持自己的角度寻找触发因素，还是从挑剔的角度？如果是后者，最好是放弃寻找，转向召唤自我接纳，因为总会有一些无法理解的触发因素。在这种情况下，自我支持的过程需要战胜“弄清楚所有事情”的健康的冲动。

The process of self-acceptance also needs to trump any of your efforts to fix the flashback when this striving becomes tainted with self-irritation and self-disappointment. Sometimes, as described above, the best understanding you can achieve is an overarching one that your inner child is feeling profoundly abandoned. She is cowering from a humiliating attack from your critic and needs for you to switch gears and demonstrate that you will care for her no matter what.  
  
自我接纳的过程也需要超越你修复闪回的努力，当这种努力被自我挫败和自我失望所玷污时。有时，如上所述，你能达到的最佳理解是一种全面的认知，即你的内在小孩感到被深深地遗弃。她正因来自你的批评者的羞辱性攻击而畏缩，她需要你转换方向，并证明无论发生什么你都会照顾她。
