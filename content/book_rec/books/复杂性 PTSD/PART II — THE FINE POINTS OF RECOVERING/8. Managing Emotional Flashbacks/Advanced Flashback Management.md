As recovery progresses, you notice more subtlety in the triggering process. As you do, you become more mindful of your inner critic’s hard-to-detect triggers. You also discover that some triggers are indiscernible. This is especially true of triggering that occurs during sleep.

随着康复的进展，你开始注意到触发过程更加微妙。在这个过程中，你更加关注内心批评难以察觉的触发因素。你还发现，有些触发因素难以辨别。这在睡眠期间发生的触发尤其如此。

Advanced flashback management, then, involves learning how to manage the disconcerting experience of falling asleep feeling reasonably put together and waking up in a flashback. Typically this occurs because a dream has triggered you into a flashback. If you remember the dream, you can sometimes figure out why it triggered you. With growing mindfulness you may even understand which events from the previous day triggered your dream.

高级的闪回管理，因此，涉及学习如何管理在感觉合理有序地入睡后醒来却陷入闪回的令人不安的经历。通常这种情况发生是因为一个梦境触发了你的闪回。如果你记得梦境，有时你可以弄清楚为什么它会触发你。随着正念的增强，你甚至可能理解前一天哪些事件触发了你的梦境。

The most difficult situation to manage is when you cannot remember the dream. This type of flashback can feel particularly unfair and discouraging. It is rich fodder for the critic, which can declare that you are not only getting nowhere in his recovery, you are getting worse.

最难管理的情况是你无法记住梦境。这种类型的闪回会感觉特别不公平和令人沮丧。这为批评者提供了丰富的素材，他们可能会宣称你不仅在康复中毫无进展，甚至还在变得更糟。
