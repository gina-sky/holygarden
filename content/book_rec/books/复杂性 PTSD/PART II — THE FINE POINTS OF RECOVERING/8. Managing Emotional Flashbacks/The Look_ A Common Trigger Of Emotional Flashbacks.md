**The Look: A Common Trigger Of Emotional Flashbacks  
  
外观：情感闪回的常见触发因素**

Early on in working with this model, I was surprised that certain clients with relatively moderate childhood abuse were plagued by emotional flashbacks. Most of them in fact were quite sure that they had never even been hit. Many of them however would talk about how they hated it when their parents gave them the look.  
  
早期使用这个模型时，我惊讶地发现一些童年遭受相对轻微虐待的客户饱受情绪闪回的困扰。事实上，他们中的大多数人都确信自己从未被打过。然而，他们中的许多人会谈论他们讨厌父母给他们那种眼神。

_The look_, in most cases, is the facial expression that typically accompanies contempt. Contempt is a powerful punishing visage backed up by an emotional force-field of intimidation and disgust. A raised voice can be added intermittently to the look to amp up its power.  
  
外观，在大多数情况下，是伴随轻蔑的表情。轻蔑是一种强大的惩罚性面容，背后是威胁和厌恶的情感防护场。可以不时地提高声音来增强这种外观的力量。

When a parent gives the look to a child, she is “telling” him that he is not only in serious jeopardy, but that he is also “a sorry excuse for a human being”. Over time, the look can make the recipient feel terrified and repugnant, as it drives him into an emotional flashback of fear and shame.  
  
当父母对孩子投去那样的眼神时，她“告诉”他，他不仅处于严重的危险之中，而且他还是“一个可怜的、不配为人的人”。随着时间的推移，这样的眼神会使接收者感到恐惧和厌恶，因为它将他带回到充满恐惧和羞耻的情感回忆中。

When the look is used to control an older child, it commonly flashes her back to an earlier, pre-memory time when the look was [[null|]]empowered by traumatizing punishment. The look rarely terrifies a child into obedience unless it has previously been paired with hitting or other dire consequences. Years of working at Parental Stress Services convinced me that most young children ignore the look unless it was previously accompanied by traumatizing punishment.  
  
当使用眼神来控制一个较大的孩子时，这通常会使她回想起一个更早的、记忆之前的时间，那时眼神因受创伤的惩罚而具有权力。除非之前已经与打骂或其他严重后果相联系，否则眼神很少会吓唬孩子使其服从。在家长压力服务工作中多年的经验使我确信，大多数小孩子会忽略眼神，除非它之前已经伴随着创伤性的惩罚。

Typically, the look is empowered via a psychological process called _conditioning_. Here is a classic example of aversive conditioning. Technicians deliver an electric shock to an animal in a cage at the same time that they ring a bell. The animal of course has a fearful and distressed response to the shock. It does not, however, take many repetitions of pairing the sound with the shock before the sound alone elicits the same upset response in the animal.  
  
通常，外观是通过一种称为条件反射的心理过程来强化的。这里有一个经典的条件反射例子。技术人员在给笼中的动物通电的同时响起铃声。当然，动物对电击有恐惧和痛苦的反应。然而，在将声音与电击配对多次之前，仅声音本身就能引起动物相同的痛苦反应。

This is analogous, I believe, to how a child learns to be terrified of the look. With enough pairings of the look with physical punishment or extreme abandonment, the parent can eventually delete the smack and get the same results with just the look. With enough repetitions in early childhood, this pairing can last a lifetime, so that the parent can control the child forever with the look. In my hospice work, I have seen several dying, ninety-pound mothers still able to put the fear of god into their huge sons with the look.  
  
这在我看来，就像孩子学会害怕某个表情一样。当表情与体罚或极端的遗弃足够多次地搭配在一起，父母最终可以省去打骂，只用表情就能达到同样的效果。在儿童早期，这种搭配足够多次后，可以持续一生，这样父母就可以用表情永远控制孩子。在我的临终关怀工作中，我见过一些临终的、体重九十磅的母亲，仍然能用眼神让她们体型庞大的儿子感到恐惧。

The look then is a powerful trigger for making adult survivors flashback to the fear and humiliation of their childhoods. Once again, many of my clients do not remember this because the punishment only had to accompany the look for a few months while they were toddlers before it became permanently wired as a trigger. Moreover, it is the rare person who has any memory before he is three or four years old.  
  
那么，这个表情就是一个强大的触发器，让成年幸存者回想起他们童年时的恐惧和羞辱。再次强调，我的许多客户不记得这些，因为惩罚只需要在他们是幼儿时伴随表情几个月，之后它就永久地成为了一个触发器。此外，很少有人能记得三岁或四岁之前的事情。

Unfortunately the look can continue to work even after the parent dies. There are at least two reasons for this.  
  
不幸的是，即使父母去世后，这个表情仍然可以发挥作用。这至少有两个原因。

First, we internalize our parents in a way that they can subliminally appear in our imaginations and give us the look whenever we are less than perfect. This includes “imperfections” in thought, feeling or action.  
  
首先，我们将父母内化，使他们能在我们的想象中隐秘地出现，并在我们不够完美时给予我们这样的眼神。这包括思想、情感或行为中的“不完美”。

[[null|]]Sadly, I often see this subliminal look mimicked on the faces of my flashbacked clients as they scowl contemptuously at themselves.  
  
遗憾的是，我经常看到这种隐秘的眼神在我回溯客户的脸上被模仿，他们对自己怒目而视。

And second, when anyone else looks at us disapprovingly, we can generalize that they are as dangerous as our parents. This is what happened to me in the emotional flashback that I described in [[1. The Journey of Recovering From Cptsd|chapter 1]].  
  
其次，当别人以不赞同的目光看待我们时，我们会泛化地认为他们像我们的父母一样危险。这就是我在第一章描述的情感回溯中发生的事情。

The worst thing about having been traumatized with the look in childhood is that we can erroneously transfer and project our memory of it onto other people when we are triggered. We are especially prone to doing this with authority figures or people that resemble our parents, even when they are not sporting the look.  
  
童年时受到带有这种眼神的创伤最糟糕的是，当我们被触发时，我们会错误地将对它的记忆转移到其他人身上。我们特别容易将这种行为用于权威人物或类似我们父母的人，即使他们没有表现出这种眼神。
