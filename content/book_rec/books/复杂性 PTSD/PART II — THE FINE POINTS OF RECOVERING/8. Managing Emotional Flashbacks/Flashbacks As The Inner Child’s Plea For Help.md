**Flashbacks As The Inner Child’s Plea For Help  
  
闪回——内心小孩的求助**

With undetectable triggers, I find that it is most helpful to see a flashback as a communication from the child that you were. The child is reminding you that he woke up feeling desolate innumerable times in that house that was not a home. He woke up daunted by the prospect of once again having to reenter the poisonous milieu of your family. The child is now asking you to meet his unmet need of having someone to go to for comfort when he wakes up feeling wretched. It is as if he is saying: “See! This is how bad it was – this is how overwhelmed, ashamed and miserable I felt so much of the time.”  
  
在没有可察觉的触发因素的情况下，我发现将闪回视为你作为孩子所收到的信息最为有益。孩子正在提醒你，他在那个不是家的房子里醒来时感到荒凉无数次。他醒来时被再次进入你家庭那种有毒环境的前景所吓倒。现在，孩子正在要求你满足他未满足的需求，即在他醒来时感到痛苦时有人可以寻求安慰。就好像他在说：“看！这就是有多糟糕——这就是我大部分时间感到多么不知所措、羞愧和痛苦。”

Managing the pain of waking up in the abandonment depression is one of the most difficult, long term challenges in recovery. Sleep seems to be a regressive, right-brain dominant experience. It is not uncommon to wake up with a temporary loss of access to the left-brain cognitive functions that control our more sophisticated understandings of our present-day reality. Without the latter, flashback management often reverts to the critic and our early childhood attempts to cope. This creates a fruitful ground for the critic to explode its arsenal of self-pathologizing programs \[enumerated in the next chapter\].  
  
管理在遗弃抑郁中醒来的痛苦是康复过程中最困难、最长期挑战之一。睡眠似乎是一种退行的、以右脑为主导的经历。醒来时暂时失去控制我们更复杂现实理解的左脑认知功能并不少见。没有后者，闪回管理往往会回归到批评者，以及我们早期童年应对的尝试。这为批评者提供了爆炸其自我病理化程序（下一章中列举）的肥沃土壤。

Years ago, I customarily responded to awakening in flashback with hypochondriasizing ruminations about my health: “What’s happening to my energy? Something must be seriously wrong with me. I feel like death warmed over. That ache in my back is probably a tumor. I lost two pounds this month. I just know its cancer! I wish I could just die and get it over with.”  
  
多年前，我习惯于用对健康担忧的沉思来回应在闪回中醒来：“我的能量怎么了？我身上肯定出了严重的问题。我感觉像是从坟墓里爬出来的人。我背上的疼痛可能是个肿瘤。这个月我瘦了两磅。我肯定它是癌症！我希望我能死去，一了百了。”

This kind of drasticizing could and did sometimes go on for hours – even days. Moreover, it typically pulled me out of the abandonment depression by creating so much anxiety, that I was forced out of bed into busyholic rushing. I would then hurry through the day unconsciously rushing to outdistance myself from this awful thinking process, as well as the abandonment pain underlying it.  
  
这种极端化的情况有时会持续数小时，甚至数天。此外，它通常通过制造大量焦虑，将我从被遗弃的抑郁中拉出来，迫使我从床上跳起来，陷入忙碌的狂热中。然后我会无意识地匆忙度过这一天，潜意识地冲出去，远离这种可怕的思维过程以及其背后的被遗弃的痛苦。

[[null|]]Because of a great deal of practice, I now quickly realize that hypochondriasizing means that I am in a flashback. Accordingly, I work to shift the focus of my thought processes to the theme of generating love and kindness to the child within me. I dedicate this work to my historical child who woke up countless times feeling horribly abandoned in my love-impoverished family of origin. For me, this is now my most practiced flashback management process: breaking my merge with the critic to concentrate on caring for myself.  
  
由于大量练习，我现在很快就能意识到疑病症意味着我正在回忆。因此，我努力将我的思维过程焦点转移到对我内心孩子的爱和善良上。我将这项工作献给我的历史孩子，他在我的爱缺乏的原生家庭中醒来无数次，感到极度被遗弃。对我来说，这现在是我最熟练的回忆管理过程：打破我与批评者的融合，专注于照顾自己。

There is another type of flashback message that seems to come from my inner child. It is that I have slipped back into my old habit of neglecting him. Often it occurs when I ignore him by regressing into overusing my flight response. My flashback then seems to be his clamoring for some proof that my compassion for him is not merely empty rhetoric. And typically when I slow down and go inside, I find that old pain of self-abandonment - that old pain that I now think of as “being lonely for myself.” Often this brings up some tears. Almost as often, crying initiates a release from my flashback.  
  
有一种闪回信息似乎来自我的内心小孩。那就是我再次回到了忽视他的老习惯。这通常发生在我用过度使用我的逃避反应来忽视他的时候。我的闪回似乎是他迫切需要一些证据，证明我对他的同情并非仅仅是空洞的言辞。通常，当我放慢速度，深入内心时，我会发现那种旧的自弃之痛——那种我现在称之为“自我孤独”的旧痛。这常常会引发泪水。几乎同样经常，哭泣会引发我从闪回中解脱出来。
