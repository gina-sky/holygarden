\*\*Internal vs. External Triggers

内部触发器与外部触发器\*\*

As we move out of early recovery, we begin to observe that internal triggers are even more common than external ones. Such triggers are commonly the nasty spawn of the inner critic. Typically they are thoughts and visualizations about endangerment or the need for perfection. The survivor may, seemingly without reason, visualize someone being abusive. Moreover he can also, seemingly out of the blue, worry himself into a flashback by simply thinking he is not perfectly executing a task that he is undertaking. He can also frighten himself by enumerating the many ways that he might mess up any upcoming task.

随着我们从早期恢复期走出来，我们开始观察到内部触发器比外部触发器更为常见。这些触发器通常是内心批评的恶果。通常，它们是关于危险或完美需求的思维和视觉化。幸存者可能会无缘无故地想象有人正在施虐。此外，他也可以毫无预兆地通过仅仅思考他正在执行的任务并不完美，就让自己陷入闪回。他还可以通过列举他可能搞砸任何即将到来的任务的许多方式来吓到自己。

When internal triggering is at its worst, small potato miscues and peccadilloes trigger us into a full blown emotional flashback. We then devolve into a polarized process of _negative-noticing_ – an incessant preoccupation with defects and hazards. We perseverate about everything that has gone or could go wrong.

当内部触发器达到最糟糕的时候，一些微不足道的小错误和缺点会触发我们进入全面的情绪闪回。然后，我们陷入了一种两极化的负面注意过程——对缺陷和危险的持续关注。我们执着于所有已经发生或可能出错的事情。

As recovery progresses, many survivors are shocked to discover that the majority of their flashbacks are triggered internally by these types of inner critic programs. We will explore below and in the next two chapters the ways we can rescue ourselves from the critic’s internal triggering processes.

随着恢复的进展，许多幸存者惊讶地发现，他们的大多数闪回都是由这些类型的内在批评程序内部触发的。我们将在下面和接下来的两章中探讨我们可以如何从批评者的内部触发过程中拯救自己。
