**Managing The Inner Critic \[Step # 8\]  
  
管理内心的批评者 \[步骤 # 8\]**

When Cptsd survivors come of age and launch from the traumatizing family, they are often unaware that their minds are dominated by an inner critic. In assisting others to manage flashbacks, the most common help I offer is to encourage them to challenge the alarmist and perfectionistic programming of the inner critic.  
  
当创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的幸存者长大成人并离开创伤性的家庭时，他们往往没有意识到自己的思想被内心的批评者所主导。在帮助他人管理闪回时，我提供的最常见的帮助是鼓励他们挑战内心批评者的恐慌和完美主义编程。

This type of scenario arises frequently in my practice. A client, in the midst of reporting an inconsequential mistake, suddenly launches into a catastrophizing tale. He reports from his critic’s nightmarish fantasy that his life is deteriorating into a cascading series of disasters. He is flashing back to the way he was continuously over-punished in childhood.  
  
这种类型的场景在我的实践中经常出现。一位客户在报告一个微不足道的错误时，突然开始讲述一个灾难性的故事。他从批评者的噩梦般的幻想中报告说，他的生活正在变成一系列接踵而至的灾难。他回想起童年时不断受到过度惩罚的方式。

One of my client’s drasticizing sounded like this: “My boss looked at me funny when I came back from my bathroom break this morning and I know he thinks I’m stupid and lazy and is going to fire me. I just know I won’t be able to get another job. My girlfriend will think I’m a loser and leave me. I’ll get sick from the stress, and with no money to pay my medical insurance and rent, I’ll soon be living out of a shopping cart.” It’s disturbing how many drasticizing inner critic rants end with up with an image of homelessness. What a symbol of abandonment!  
  
我的客户中的一个极端化想法是这样的：“今天早上我从洗手间回来，老板用奇怪的眼神看着我，我知道他认为我很愚蠢、懒惰，并且打算解雇我。我确信我找不到另一份工作。我的女朋友会认为我是一个失败者，离开我。我会因为压力而生病，没有钱支付医疗保险和房租，我很快就会无家可归，住在购物车里。”令人不安的是，许多极端化的内心批评狂潮都以无家可归的形象结束。这是一个多么象征性的被遗弃的标志啊！

Recovering requires being able to recognize inner-critic catastrophizing so that we can resist it with _thought-stopping and thought-correction_. In this case, I reminded my client of the many [[null|]]times we had caught his critic “freaking out” about every conceivable way his life could go down the tubes. I then encouraged him to refuse to indulge this process, and to angrily say “no” to the critic every time it tried to scare or demean him.  
  
恢复需要能够识别内心的批评家灾难化思维，以便我们能通过思维停止和思维纠正来抵制它。在这种情况下，我提醒我的客户，我们曾多次捕捉到他的批评家“惊慌失措”地担心他的生活以各种可能的方式走向深渊。然后我鼓励他拒绝沉溺于这个过程，每次批评家试图吓唬或贬低他时，都愤怒地说“不”。

Finally, I reminded him of all the positive experiences he actually had with his boss \[thought-correction\]. I also helped him enumerate his many successes at work, at school and at life in general.  
  
最后，我提醒他实际上与老板之间所有的积极经历\[纠正想法\]。我还帮助他列举他在工作中、在学校以及生活中取得的许多成功。

The inner critic not only exacerbates flashbacks, but eventually grows into a psychic agency that triggers them. Reversing the damaging effects of the critic is the subject of the next two chapters  
  
内心批评不仅加剧了闪回，最终还会发展成一个触发它们的心理机构。下一章将探讨如何逆转批评的破坏性影响。
