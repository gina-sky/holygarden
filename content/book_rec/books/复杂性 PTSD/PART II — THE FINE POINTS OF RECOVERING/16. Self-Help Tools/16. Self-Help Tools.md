SELF-HELP TOOLS  
  
自助工具

This chapter is composed of six toolboxes, each with a set of tools to address different recovery issues. Nonetheless, I still value these lists as indispensable adjuncts to my own journey of recovering. I often hand out these lists to clients at appropriate times in their journey. I also give them to students who attend my classes. I have received a great deal of positive feedback about how helpful they have been to enhancing recovery.  
  
本章由六个工具箱组成，每个工具箱都包含一系列工具，用于解决不同的康复问题。尽管如此，我仍然认为这些列表是我自己康复旅程中不可或缺的辅助工具。我经常在客户康复旅程的适当时候向他们分发这些列表。我也把它们给参加我课程的学生。我收到了很多关于这些列表如何有助于增强康复的积极反馈。

My friends and clients whose recovery progresses at the greatest rate are those who supplement their therapy with self-help activities. Those who print out these lists, and carry them around or post them in a conspicuous place until they are deeply ingrained seem to take a quantum leap in their recovery.  
  
那些在康复过程中进展最快的亲朋好友和客户，都是那些在治疗之外补充自助活动的人。那些打印出这些列表，随身携带或将它们贴在显眼位置，直到它们深入人心的人，似乎在康复上取得了飞跃。

I hope that you become immersed in these lists, and that they give you the healing support that I have seen so many others receive from them.  
  
我希望你能沉浸在这些列表中，它们能给你提供我所看到的其他人从它们那里获得的疗愈支持。
