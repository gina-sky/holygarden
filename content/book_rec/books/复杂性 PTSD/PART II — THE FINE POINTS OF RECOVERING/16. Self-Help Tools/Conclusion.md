I hope and pray that much sooner than later you will experience an increasing access to the silver linings I described in [[4. The Progression of Recovering|chapter 4]]. I hope you sense the ongoing resolution of your developmental [[null|]]arrests. I hope you will notice an increasing kindness to yourself and a pride in the beautiful uniqueness of yourself. I hope you become as fierce in your allegiance to yourself as you need to be to feel that you safely belong to the world. I further hope that the benefits of your improved emotional intelligence will bring you at least one intimate relationship where you can ongoingly discover the benefits of safe and multidimensional relating.  
  
我希望并祈祷，你将比预期更快地体验到我在第四章中描述的银色 lining。我希望你能感受到你的发展停滞正在持续解决。我希望你能注意到对自己越来越友善，以及对自己美丽独特性的自豪。我希望你能像你需要的那样，对自己忠诚得如此坚定，以感到自己安全地属于这个世界。我还希望，你提高的情绪智力带来的好处至少能让你拥有一个亲密关系，在那里你可以持续发现安全且多维联系的好处。
