献词

To my wife, Sara Weinberg. To my son, Jaden Michael Walker.  
献给我的妻子，萨拉·魏因伯格。献给我的儿子，贾登·迈克尔·沃克。

You both show me on a daily basis that I have escaped my parents’ legacy of contempt, that I can nurture our family with love and kindness and that I am ongoingly healed by the love and kindness that you generously shower upon me.  
你们俩每天都在向我展示，我已经摆脱了父母那一代的蔑视，我能用爱和善意来滋养我们的家庭，而且我不断地被你们慷慨给予我的爱和善意所治愈。

I also dedicate this book to those who on a regular basis were verbally and emotionally abused at the dinner table, and I pray that this book will help you heal any damage that was done to you and your relationship with food.  
我还将这本书献给我那些在餐桌上经常遭受言语和情感虐待的人，我祈祷这本书能帮助你们治愈因你们和食物的关系所受到的任何伤害。
