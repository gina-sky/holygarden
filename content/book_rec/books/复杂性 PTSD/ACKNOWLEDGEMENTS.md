ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
致谢

I am grateful to all my lovely clients who, over the last three decades, honored me with their brave vulnerability and authenticity. Their stories verified to me that there is an epidemic of poor parenting, and their inspiring work proved to me that the effects of it could be largely overcome.  
我感谢所有可爱的客户，在过去三十年里，他们以勇敢的脆弱和真诚来尊重我。他们的故事向我证实了存在一个糟糕的育儿现象，他们鼓舞人心的工作向我证明，这种影响可以很大程度上被克服。

I am also grateful to the readers of my first book and to my website respondents whose generous feedback greatly alleviated my performance anxiety about writing another book and putting my words out there for public viewing. Their overwhelmingly positive support ameliorates the fear that my words will be used as weapons against me as they so often were in childhood.  
我也感谢我的第一本书的读者和我的网站回复者，他们的慷慨反馈极大地缓解了我写作另一本书并将我的文字公之于众时的表现焦虑。他们压倒性的积极支持减轻了我担心我的文字会被用作对我的武器，就像它们在童年时经常发生的那样。

I am grateful to my good friend Bill O’Brien who gave me invaluable editorial assistance.  
我还要感谢我的好朋友比尔·奥布莱恩，他给了我宝贵的编辑帮助。

I am grateful to all those writers listed in the Bibliography, and those unlisted, whose ideas have fertilized my mind and helped me to write this book.  
我对列入参考文献中的所有作家，以及未列入的作家，表示感激，他们的思想丰富了我的思维，帮助我写下了这本书。

I am grateful to my friends in recovery with whom I have shared the process of mutual commiseration. We have aided each other greatly in our journeys of recovery.  
我对与我分享相互慰藉过程的康复朋友们表示感激。我们在康复之旅中互相帮助很大。

I am not an academic expert on Complex PTSD \[Cptsd\]. I have read and studied a great deal, but by no means exhaustively, and I do not make it a point to religiously keep up with all the latest developments. What I bring to the table here is almost 30 years of treating trauma survivors in individual and group settings. What I describe here is a pragmatic, multidimensional approach to recovering based on what I have seen work with my clients, my loved ones and myself.  
我不是复杂 PTSD（Cptsd）的学术专家。我阅读和学习了很多，但绝不是全面深入，我也不刻意去追踪所有最新的发展。我这里提供的是近 30 年来在个体和团体环境中治疗创伤幸存者的经验。我这里描述的是一种基于我所见有效的方法的实用、多维度的恢复方法，这些方法适用于我的客户、我的亲人以及我自己。
