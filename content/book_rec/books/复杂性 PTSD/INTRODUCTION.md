引言

If you’re in immediate distress, please turn to [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]], and read the list of 13 steps for reducing Cptsd fear and stress.  
如果您正处于紧急困境中，请查阅第 8 章，阅读减少 Cptsd 恐惧和压力的 13 个步骤。

Forty years ago, I was riding on a train in India travelling from Delhi to Calcutta. I was at the end of a failed, yearlong spiritual quest in India. Instead of enlightenment, my salvation fantasy had only netted me despair and amoebic dysentery. The latter cost me thirty pounds of flesh, and left me looking like an emaciated monk.  
四十年前，我在印度乘坐火车从德里前往加尔各答。我在印度进行的一年多的精神追求以失败告终。我的救赎幻想不仅让我陷入绝望，还让我患上了阿米巴痢疾。后者让我失去了三十磅体重，让我看起来像一位消瘦的僧侣。

Even worse was the absolute loss of the hope that had been inflamed by reading Walt Whitman’s “Song of the Open Road.” This hope had supported me through five years of world travel after I was unceremoniously kicked out of my family home.  
更糟糕的是，我失去了阅读沃尔特·惠特曼的《开放之路之歌》所激发的希望。这种希望支撑着我，在我被无礼地从家中赶出后，我开始了五年世界旅行。

But, back to the train. I was sitting in my cramped second class seat with the untouchables, chickens and goats, reading an English version of an Indian newspaper. The paper informed me that my destination, Calcutta, was now inundated with 100,000 refugees from Bangladesh who had just fled their flood–swamped homes. They were all apparently sleeping on the downtown streets in the recesses beneath the protruding second floors of all the buildings that lined the streets.  
但，回到火车上。我坐在拥挤的二等车厢里，和不可接触者、鸡、山羊一起，阅读一份印度报纸的英文版。报纸告诉我，我的目的地，加尔各答，现在涌入了一万名来自孟加拉国的难民，他们刚刚逃离了被洪水淹没的家园。他们显然都在市中心街道上，睡在所有沿街建筑的凸出二楼的隐蔽处。

I came in late at night and sure enough, sleeping bodies wrapped in sheets, shoulder to shoulder, lined the streets everywhere. I checked into a twenty cents-a-night hotel that a fellow traveler [[null|]]had told me about. I slept unevenly, dreading the sight that I would behold the next morning. How would I handle viewing masses of desperate people, especially when I had nothing to give? I doubted that I even had enough money to make it to Australia where I could hopefully replenish my wallet.  
我深夜到达，果然，街道上到处都是裹着床单、肩并肩入睡的身体。我住进了一家旅伴告诉我的每晚二十美分的旅馆。我睡得不安稳，害怕第二天早上看到的景象。我该如何面对那些绝望的人群，尤其是当我一无所有的时候？我怀疑自己甚至没有足够的钱到达澳大利亚，希望在那里我能补充我的钱包。

When I finally nudged myself down the stairs late the next morning, I was aghast at the transformed scene on the streets. Sheets had been spread out like picnic blankets and each hosted happy families. Little portable stoves produced meals and cups of tea. People bantered with incredible vitality and enthusiasm, and children...children \[this was the part that emblazoned on my memory\] crawled all over their parents, especially their fathers in affectionate playful gymnastics that their fathers seemed to love as much as they did.  
第二天早上，当我终于挣扎着下楼时，我被街道上发生的转变惊呆了。床单被铺展开来，就像野餐毯一样，每个地方都聚集着快乐的家庭。便携式炉子煮着饭菜和茶。人们用惊人的活力和热情交谈，孩子们……孩子们\[这是我记忆中难以忘怀的部分\]在他们父母身上爬来爬去，尤其是他们的父亲，他们用充满爱意的嬉戏体操来取悦父亲，而父亲们似乎也和他们一样喜欢。

I was flooded with a mélange of feelings unlike anything I’d ever experienced before - a strange cocktail of relief, delight and anxiety. The anxiety I wouldn’t understand until ten years later when I realized that envy had been percolating below the surface of my awareness.  
我心中涌动着一种前所未有的复杂情感混合体——一种奇怪的混合了释然、喜悦和焦虑的鸡尾酒。这种焦虑直到十年后我才理解，那时我意识到嫉妒一直在我的意识表层下暗流涌动。

I was deeply envious of this gorgeous buffet of familial love that I had never experienced or even witnessed before. The family sitcoms – even the syrupy sweet ones - that I had watched growing up came nowhere near creating such an authentic, tactile representation of healthy bonding and attachment.  
我对这种我从未经历过甚至从未见证过的美好家庭爱意感到深深的嫉妒。我小时候看过的家庭情景喜剧——即使是那些过于甜蜜的——都无法创造出这样真实、触动人心的健康联系和依恋的体现。

When I realized what this was years later as an anthropology and social work student, I positively flashed back to other non-industrial countries where I had seen similar scenes on a less grand level: Morocco, Thailand, Bali, and an Aboriginal reserve in Australia.  
当我多年后作为人类学和社会工作学生意识到这一点时，我脑海中清晰地浮现出我在其他非工业化国家看到过的类似场景，尽管规模较小：摩洛哥、泰国、巴厘岛，以及澳大利亚的一个土著保护区。

These memories also viscerally informed me about the kind of relational love I had never seen in my own or my friends’ families. As I digested this experience over the years and used it to overcome my denial about what I had missed out on as a child, I began the [[null|]]decades long quest that has lead me to write this book as well as _The Tao of Fully Feeling,_ which precedes it. The Tao of Fully Feeling is a companion to this book and elaborates many of the foundational principles of this book.  
这些记忆也让我深刻地了解到了我从未在自己或朋友的家人中见过的那种关系之爱。随着我逐年消化这段经历，并利用它来克服我对童年所错过的东西的否认，我开始了一段长达数十年的追求，这使我写下了这本书，以及它之前的《全然感受的道》。《全然感受的道》是这本书的伴侣，并详细阐述了这本书的许多基础原则。

This book then is my hopeful effort to create a map that you can follow to heal the wounds that come from not enough childhood love. If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like shrinking the critic and grieving the losses of childhood, it is my attempt to find different ways to emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again. If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always be key portals for reentry.  
这本书是我充满希望的努力，旨在创建一张你可以遵循的地图，以治愈因童年爱不够而带来的创伤。如果我有时在缩小批评者和哀悼童年损失等问题上有些重复，那是因为我试图找到不同的方式来强调反复参与这些恢复工作主题的重要性。如果你发现自己迷失了方向，不确定如何回到地图上，这些主题将始终是重新进入的关键门户。

I sometimes recommend that readers view the table of contents and start with whatever headings most strike a chord. Although the book is laid out in a somewhat linear fashion, everyone’s journey of recovering is different, and journeys can be initiated in a variety of ways.  
我有时建议读者查看目录，从最触动自己的标题开始阅读。尽管这本书的布局多少有些线性，但每个人的康复之旅都是不同的，而且旅程可以通过各种方式开始。

Journeys of recovering may begin when a death or great loss brings up an emotional storm that opens up a hidden reservoir of childhood pain; or when a friend shares something about his or her recovery process that strikes a chord; or when a book or TV show triggers a more serious consideration of what really happened in childhood; or when something gets “opened up” in couple’s therapy; or when a healing crisis in the form of panic attacks or a nervous breakdown requires some outside help; or when the self-medicating strategies developed to soothe depression and anxiety get out of control and also require outside help.  
康复之旅可能始于死亡或重大损失引发的情感风暴，揭开隐藏的童年痛苦之库；或者当朋友分享他们的康复过程，触动你的心弦；或者当一本书或电视节目引发对童年真正发生的事情的更深入思考；或者当夫妻治疗中“打开”了一些事情；或者当恐慌发作或精神崩溃等治疗危机需要外部帮助；或者当用于缓解抑郁和焦虑的自我用药策略失控，也需要外部帮助。

I hope that readers will be able to use this book as a textbook for recovering, and that certain sections will call you back or forward to them repeatedly, as over time and with effective work, certain themes continue to take on ever deepening meaning.  
我希望读者能够将这本书作为康复的教科书使用，并希望某些章节会反复吸引你回到它们或向前推进，因为随着时间的推移和有效的工作，某些主题会继续具有越来越深刻的含义。

[[null|]]In this vein, you will find that the Table of Contents is quite comprehensive, and sometimes the best way to use this book is to browse through it and then read the sections and chapters that most capture your interest.  
在这个意义上，你会发现目录非常全面，有时使用这本书的最佳方式是浏览它，然后阅读那些最能吸引你兴趣的章节和部分。

Moreover, this is not a one size fits all formula for recovering. Depending on the specific pattern of your childhood trauma, some of the advice contained herein may be less relevant or even irrelevant to you. Please then focus on the material that seems applicable and helpful to you.  
此外，这并不是一个适用于所有恢复的通用公式。根据你童年创伤的具体模式，这里的一些建议可能对你来说不太相关，甚至完全不相关。请专注于那些似乎适用于并对你有帮助的材料。

I also hope this map will guide you to heal in a way that helps you become an unflinching source of kindness and self-compassion for yourself, and that out of that journey you will find at least one other human being who will reciprocally love you well enough in that way.  
我也希望这张地图能引导你以有助于你成为自己坚定的善良和自我同情之源的方式去治愈，并且在那段旅程中，你至少会找到另一个足够爱你的人。
