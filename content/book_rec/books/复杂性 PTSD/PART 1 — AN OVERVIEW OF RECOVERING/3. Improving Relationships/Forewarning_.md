**Forewarning:  
  
预警：**

There are instances of parental betrayal so extreme, that it is not fair or reasonable to expect the survivor to try to trust human beings again. If the recommendation in this chapter to open to the help of others feels too upsetting or overwhelming, please feel free to skip this chapter. There is a great deal of other material in this book that can help alleviate the many symptoms of Cptsd, and since recovery is relative and never complete, you do not need to implement everything in this book. As they say in the Twelve Step Movement: “Take the best and leave the rest.”  
  
有些父母背叛行为极其严重，对幸存者来说，期望他们再次信任人类是不公平或不合理的。如果本章中关于向他人寻求帮助的建议让你感到过于痛苦或难以承受，请随时跳过这一章。这本书中还有许多其他内容可以帮助缓解许多创伤后应激障碍的症状，而且由于恢复是相对的，永远不会完全，你不需要实施这本书中的所有内容。正如十二步运动中所说：“取其精华，去其糟粕。”

Moreover, as I have experienced personally, and as numerous of my clients and website respondents have demonstrated to me, real relational healing can and does come from non-human sources. This is especially true of mammalian pets whose attachment needs and wiring are similar enough to ours that mutually healing [[null|]]connections can evolve between us. Dogs and cats can be a tremendous source of what Carl Rogers describes as the “unconditional positive regard” that young children must have in order to thrive.  
  
此外，正如我亲身经历的那样，以及我的许多客户和网站回应者向我展示的那样，真正的关系修复确实可以来自非人类来源。这尤其适用于哺乳动物宠物，它们的依恋需求和大脑回路与我们足够相似，以至于我们之间可以发展出相互治愈的联系。狗和猫可以成为卡尔·罗杰斯所说的“无条件积极关注”的巨大来源，这是幼儿为了茁壮成长所必需的。

Other therapeutic relational sources include nature, music and the arts. Moreover, for some survivors, authors of helpful books can be kept at safe distances while they contribute to your healing.  
  
其他治疗性关系来源包括自然、音乐和艺术。此外，对于一些幸存者来说，有益书籍的作者可以保持安全距离，同时他们有助于你的康复。

Finally, even with the most heinous betrayals, miracles sometime happen in terms of discovering a healing human connection, particularly in the later stages of recovery.  
  
最后，即使是最恶劣的背叛，有时在发现治愈性的人性连接方面也会发生奇迹，尤其是在康复的后期阶段。
