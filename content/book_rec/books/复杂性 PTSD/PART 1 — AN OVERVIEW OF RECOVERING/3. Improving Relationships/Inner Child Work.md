**Inner Child Work  
  
内在小孩工作**

Let us return to the concept of self-mothering. As mother to ourselves, we commit to increasing our self-compassion and unconditional positive regard. Self-mothering is a resolute refusal to indulge in self-hatred and self-abandonment. It proceeds from the realization that self-punishment is counterproductive. It is enhanced by the understanding that patience and self-encouragement are more effective than self-judgment and self-rejection in achieving recovery.  
  
让我们回到自我养育的概念。作为自己的母亲，我们致力于增加自我同情和无条件积极关注。自我养育是对自我仇恨和自我放弃的坚决拒绝。它源于意识到自我惩罚是无效的。通过理解耐心和自我鼓励比自我评判和自我拒绝更有效地实现康复。

You can enhance your self-mothering skills by imaginatively creating a safe place in your heart where your inner child and your present time self are always welcome. Consistent tenderness towards yourself welcomes the child into the adult body you now [[null|]]inhabit, and shows him that it is now a nurturing place protected by a warm and powerful adult.  
  
你可以通过在心中想象性地创造一个安全的地方来提高自我养育的技能，那里你的内在小孩和现在的自我总是受欢迎的。对你自己的一致温柔欢迎孩子进入你现在居住的成人身体，并告诉他，现在这是一个由温暖而强大的成人保护着的养育之地。

Self-mothering can be enhanced by thought-correcting the critic’s negative messages with healing words that the child in all likelihood never heard from his parents. A client of mine once shared this pearl of wisdom with me: “Thoughts - just mere thoughts - are as powerful as electric batteries - as good for you as sunlight is, or as bad for you as poison.”  
  
通过用孩子很可能从未从父母那里听到的治愈性话语纠正批评者的负面信息，可以增强自我养育。我的一个客户曾经与我分享了这个智慧的珍珠：“思想——仅仅是思想——像电池一样强大——对你来说，就像阳光一样好，或者像毒药一样坏。”

Here then are some useful messages for nurturing the growth of your self-compassion and self-esteem. I recommend that you imagine speaking them to your inner child, especially when you are suffering with a flashback.  
  
这里有一些有助于培养您的自我同情和自尊心的有用信息。我建议您想象着对您的内在小孩说出这些话，尤其是在您经历创伤后闪回的时候。
