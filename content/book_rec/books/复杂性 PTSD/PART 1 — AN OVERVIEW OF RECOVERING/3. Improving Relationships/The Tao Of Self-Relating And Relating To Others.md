**The Tao Of Self-Relating And Relating To Others  
  
自我关系与人际关系的道**

Recovering is therefore enhanced on every level by safe human help. Once again however, survivors with especially harsh betrayal histories may need to do a great deal of work on other levels before they are ready to risk the vulnerability of opening to relational help.  
  
因此，在每一个层面上，恢复都通过安全的人性帮助得到加强。然而，再次强调，那些有特别严酷背叛历史幸存者可能需要在其他层面上做大量工作，才能准备好冒险开放，寻求关系上的帮助。

Nonetheless, deep level recovering, as well as healthy “human-being” is typically a vacillating blend of self-help and help from others. Relational work helps heal the initial wound of family abandonment, and self work decreases the self-abandonment that occurs because the child was forced to imitate his parents’ abandonment of him. The more time you practice the various techniques of self-care described throughout this book, the less time you spend in [[null|]]self-abandonment. With enough persistence, self-care becomes an invaluable, irreplaceable habit.  
  
尽管如此，深层次的恢复以及健康的“人”通常是一种自我帮助和他人帮助的摇摆组合。关系工作有助于治愈家庭遗弃的初始创伤，而自我工作则减少了由于孩子被迫模仿父母对他的遗弃而发生的自我遗弃。你练习这本书中描述的各种自我照顾技巧的时间越多，你在自我遗弃中花费的时间就越少。只要有足够的毅力，自我照顾就会成为一种无价且不可替代的习惯。

In advanced recovery, self-help and relational-help blend in an all important Tao. A Tao is a yin/yang combination of opposite and complementary forces. _The Tao of relational recovery_ involves balancing healthy independence with healthy dependence on others.  
  
在高级恢复过程中，自助和互助融合成至关重要的道。道是阴阳结合的相反和互补力量。关系恢复之道涉及平衡健康的独立与对他人健康的依赖。

For the survivor, this therapeutic synthesis can come into being when an improved supportive relationship with yourself allows you to choose and open to a helpful relationship. Sometimes simultaneously, the attainment of a safe, supportive relationship with another person promotes the growth of your ability to be self-supportive. This then rewards you with a decrease in your automatic tendency toward self-abandonment. Complementarily, this then fosters the gradual development of community – the vital life resource that you were so unfairly deprived of in childhood.  
  
对于幸存者来说，当与自己的关系得到改善，能够选择并开放接受一段有益的关系时，这种治疗性综合就会产生。有时，与另一个人建立一段安全、支持性的关系，会促进你自我支持能力的发展。这随后会减少你自动放弃自我的倾向。相应地，这也会促进社区——你在童年时期被不公平剥夺的至关重要的生活资源的逐渐发展。

The more self-supportive we become the more we attract supportive others. The more we are supported by others, the more we can support ourselves. Sometimes we get initiated into this dynamic Tao by our own efforts - sometimes by the grace of finding a supportive friend or professional helper.  
  
我们越能自我支持，就越能吸引到支持性的他人。我们得到他人的支持越多，就越能自我支持。有时，我们通过自己的努力进入这种动态的道——有时是通过找到一位支持性的朋友或专业助手的恩典。

For many of us survivors a considerable amount of self-help work has to take place before we are able to open to relational support – before we become discerning enough to choose truly safe and helpful support.  
  
对于我们许多幸存者来说，在能够开放接受关系支持——在我们足够明智地选择真正安全、有益的支持之前——必须进行大量的自我帮助工作。
