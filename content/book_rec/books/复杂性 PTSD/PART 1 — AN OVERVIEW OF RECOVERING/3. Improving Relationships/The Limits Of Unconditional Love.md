**The Limits Of Unconditional Love  
  
无条件爱的局限**

The terrible absence of love - or its abrupt premature termination - is extremely painful and its loss is very difficult to address. We cannot help desperately wanting the unconditional love we were so unfairly deprived of, but we cannot, as adults, expect others to supply our unmet early entitlement needs.  
  
爱的可怕缺失——或者其突然的过早终止——是极其痛苦的，而且很难应对这种失去。我们无法帮助自己绝望地想要得到我们如此不公平地剥夺了的无条件爱，但作为成年人，我们无法期望他人来满足我们未满足的早期权利需求。

The one exception to this is therapy, but that of course is usually only one or two hours a week. Miraculously, I have seen the unconditional positive regard of the therapist be enough on numerous occasions to significantly repair the damage of not being parentally [[null|]]loved. And when it is enough, the therapist’s consistent caring facilitates the awakening of the developmentally arrested need to hold yourself with enough unconditional love.  
  
这一点的例外是治疗，但当然这通常只是一周一到两个小时。奇迹般地，我见过治疗师的无条件积极关注在许多场合足以显著修复缺乏父母之爱的伤害。而当它足够时，治疗师的持续关怀有助于唤醒发展停滞的需要，即用足够无条件的爱来关爱自己。

We survivors often struggle with managing our understandable but unrealistic yearnings to receive permanent unconditional love from a friend or partner. Like the toddler, we eventually have to accept the limits of adult love. This is especially true in romance where the intoxication of unconditional love rarely lasts for more than year. Around this time, partners inevitably begin to feel some frustration with each other because of differences in their individual needs.  
  
我们这些幸存者常常在与管理我们理解但并不切实际的对朋友或伴侣获得永久无条件爱的渴望作斗争。就像幼儿一样，我们最终必须接受成人爱的限制。这在浪漫关系中尤其如此，无条件爱的陶醉很少能持续超过一年。在这个时候，由于个人需求的差异，伴侣不可避免地开始对彼此感到一些挫败。

Nonetheless, romantic love can be a significant source of therapeutic unconditional-like love, especially when it survives the inevitability of some disappointment. Susan Campbell’s _A Couples’ Journey_ is a pragmatic, research-based book on how to reap more intimacy out of normal relationship disappointments  
  
尽管如此，浪漫爱情可以是治疗性无条件爱的一个重要来源，尤其是在它克服了一些失望的必然性之后。苏珊·坎贝尔的《夫妻之旅》是一本基于研究的实用书籍，讲述了如何从正常关系中的失望中获得更多的亲密感。
