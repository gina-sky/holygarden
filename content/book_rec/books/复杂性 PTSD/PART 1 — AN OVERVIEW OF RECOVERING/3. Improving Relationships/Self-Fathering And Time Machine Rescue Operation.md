\*\*Self-Fathering And Time Machine Rescue Operation

自我父爱和时间机器救援行动\*\*

Many abandoned children enter adulthood feeling that the world is a dangerous place where they are ill-equipped to defend themselves. While self-mothering focuses primarily on healing the wounds of neglect, self-fathering heals the wounds of being helpless to protect yourself from parental abuse, and by extension from other abusive authority figures.

许多被遗弃的孩子进入成年时，感觉这个世界是一个危险的地方，他们没有足够的防御能力来保护自己。虽然自我母爱主要关注治愈忽视的创伤，自我父爱则治愈因无力保护自己免受父母虐待，以及由此延伸出的其他施虐权威人物的伤害。

Self-fathering aims at building assertiveness and self-protection. It includes learning to effectively confront external and/or internal abuse, as well as standing up for the adult child’s rights, as described in Tool Box 2 of [[16. Self-Help Tools|chapter 16]]. Many survivors benefit greatly from classes and books on assertiveness training.

自我养育旨在建立自信和自我保护。它包括学习如何有效地对抗外部和/或内部虐待，以及为成年子女的权利而斗争，如第 16 章工具箱 2 中所述。许多幸存者从自信训练的课程和书籍中受益匪浅。

One of my favorite self-fathering exercises is the _time machine rescue operation_. I have used it to help myself and to help clients. With clients I use it to model a process for fighting off the overwhelming sense of helplessness that often accompanies emotional flashbacks.

我最喜欢的自我养育练习之一是时间机器救援行动。我用它来帮助自己和帮助客户。在客户身上，我用它来模拟一个过程，以对抗经常伴随着情感闪回的压倒性的无助感。

This is a version of the time machine rescue operation that I use with myself as well as with my clients. I tell my inner child that, if time travel is ever possible, I will travel back into the past and put a stop to my parents’ abusiveness. In the course of this I say things like: “I’ll call 911. I’ll call CPS \[Child Protective Services\] on them. I will grab their arms and pin them behind their backs the second they try to strike you. I will muffle them with a gag so they can’t scream at you or even mumble their criticisms. I’ll put bags over their heads so they can’t frown or glare at you. I’ll send them to bed without dessert. I’ll do anything you want me to do to protect you.”

这是一个我既用于自己也用于客户的时光机器救援行动版本。我告诉我内心的孩子，如果时光旅行成为可能，我会回到过去阻止父母的虐待行为。在这个过程中，我说些像这样的话：“我会拨打 911。我会向他们报告 CPS\[儿童保护服务\]。在他们试图打你的时候，我会抓住他们的手臂，把他们按在背后。我会用塞子堵住他们的嘴，这样他们就不能对你尖叫或低声抱怨。我会把袋子套在他们头上，这样他们就不能皱眉或瞪着你。我会让他们没有甜点就去睡觉。我会做你想要我做的一切来保护你。”

Such imagery often provides me an exit out of fear and shame, and sometimes even makes my inner child laugh in delight. I sometimes finish this exercise by telling my inner child I would also report my parents to the authorities so they would be sent to counseling to learn how to be a better parent.

这样的想象常常让我从恐惧和羞愧中解脱出来，有时甚至让我的内心小孩开心地笑。我有时会通过告诉我的内心小孩我也会向当局举报我的父母，让他们去接受咨询，学习如何成为一个更好的父母来结束这个练习。

[[null|]]Or, I say that, if I could, I would take him back to live with me in the future before all those horrible things could happen to him. I remind him that he in fact lives in the present with me now, where I will always do my best to protect him. We now have a powerful body, greater skills of self-protection and access to allies and a legal system that will protect us.

或者，我说，如果我能的话，我会把他带回到未来，在我这里生活，在他遭遇那些可怕的事情之前。我提醒他，他实际上现在就和我一起生活在当下，我会尽我所能保护他。我们现在有一个强大的身体，更高级的自我保护技能，以及可以依靠的盟友和法律体系来保护我们。

When the recoveree consistently welcomes his inner child in every aspect of his being, the child feels increasingly safe and becomes more and more alive and self-expressive. As he experiences his adult self consistently rising to his defense, he will feel safe enough to begin accessing his innate vitality, playfulness, curiosity, and spontaneity.

当康复者始终在生活的各个方面欢迎他内心的孩子时，这个孩子会感到越来越安全，变得越来越有活力和自我表达。随着他不断体验到他的成人自我在为他辩护，他会感到足够安全，开始接触他内在的生命力、嬉戏、好奇心和自发性。
