**A Journey Of Relational Healing  
  
关系疗愈之旅**

The incident I am about to describe marked a huge step in my long, gradual journey of opening to real intimacy. I was sitting on my [[null|]]porch with my dog George, the only being I could truly relax with, when he broke his lead and sprinted across the street in pursuit of a cat. Before he could get to the cat, he was run over by a car – both axels-run over. It was the worst thing that ever happened in my adult life, and when the shock \[dissociation\] wore off, I was drowning in the abandonment mélange.  
  
我即将描述的事件标志着我漫长而逐渐的迈向真实亲密关系的巨大一步。我正和我的狗乔治坐在门廊上，他是唯一我能真正放松的伙伴，这时他挣脱了牵引绳，冲过街道去追一只猫。在他到达猫之前，他被一辆车撞倒——两个轮子都压过去了。这是我成年生活中发生的最糟糕的事情，当震惊\[解离\]消退后，我沉浸在被遗弃的混合情绪中。

Beyond devastated, I felt panicky and catatonic at the same time. As I had to in childhood when feeling overwhelmed, I hid in my room for thirty-six hours - dreading contact with my fair weather friend-roommates. I was 28 and still thoroughly phobic about showing any vulnerability. All my relationships had been developed under the guise of my people-pleasing, funny guy persona, and in my current state there was not a joke anywhere to be found. There was no way I would let myself be seen in what felt like a repulsive condition.  
  
除了极度悲痛，我还同时感到恐慌和木僵。就像我在童年时期感到不知所措时必须做的那样，我躲在我的房间里连续 36 个小时——害怕接触那些晴朗天气的朋友室友。我 28 岁，仍然非常害怕表现出任何脆弱。我所有的关系都是在我的取悦他人、搞笑的人设下发展的，而在我现在的状态下，找不到任何笑话。我绝不可能让自己在这种感觉像是令人厌恶的状态下被人看到。

I could not sleep, and as sleep deprivation deteriorated into a fear that I was truly going crazy, out of nowhere came this amazing grace. Grace disguised in a form I usually abhorred. It was the grace of a deep surrender into weeping - a long sobbing release more soothing than anything I had ever experienced before.  
  
我无法入睡，随着睡眠剥夺演变成我真正发疯的恐惧，突然间降临了这种惊人的恩典。恩典以一种我通常厌恶的形式出现。这是一种深入到哭泣中的恩典——一种比我所经历过的任何事物都更舒缓的长久抽泣释放。

It was the release I describe in [[11. Grieving|chapter 11]] and extensively throughout my first book. When the tears were cried out I knew I would be okay and I knew I was not going to go crazy. I could face my roommates with the realest, perhaps the first sense of self-esteem I had ever known. And from that point on, I knew I wanted more of these incredibly healing tears.  
  
这就是我在第 11 章以及我的第一本书中广泛描述的释放。当泪水流尽时，我知道我会没事的，我知道我不会发疯。我可以带着最真实，也许是我所知道的第一种自尊面对室友。从那时起，我知道我想要更多这种极其治愈的泪水。
