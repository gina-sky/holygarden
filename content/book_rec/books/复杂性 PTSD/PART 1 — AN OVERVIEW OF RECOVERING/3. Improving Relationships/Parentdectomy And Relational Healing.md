\*\*Parentdectomy And Relational Healing

亲子分离与关系疗愈\*\*

I have worked with many clients who began therapy with me while they were still over-controlled by their traumatizing parents – both externally, as well as internally. Sometimes the control was enforced by as little as one phone call a week.

我曾与许多客户合作，他们在接受治疗时仍然受到创伤性父母的过度控制——无论是外部还是内部。有时，这种控制仅仅通过一周一次的电话就得以实施。

Not infrequently, these clients were also being overpowered and /or abandoned in relationships as abusive and neglectful as the ones they had with their parents. This is repetition compulsion at its most destructive, and it strands survivors in experiencing the worst of both worlds.

这些客户在关系中也被过度控制或被遗弃，这些关系如同他们与父母的关系一样，充满了虐待和忽视。这是最具破坏性的重复强迫行为，让幸存者陷入两个世界的最糟糕之处。

Through in depth exploration of their childhood trauma, many of my still-trapped clients achieved psychological freedom from their parents for the first time in their lives. Once again, this was a freedom that they had not actually achieved even though they had been living on their own for decades.

通过深入探索他们的童年创伤，许多仍然被困的客户第一次在他们的生活中获得了从父母那里获得的心理自由。再次强调，这是一种他们尽管独自生活了几十年却从未真正实现的自由。

These clients gradually learned to live more successfully on their own without their parents over-controlling spoiling influence. Their ability to build self-nurturing relationships with themselves almost always correlated with a major reduction or complete severing of their relationships with their parents.

这些客户逐渐学会了在没有父母的过度控制和宠溺影响下更成功地独立生活。他们与自己建立自我滋养关系的能几乎总是与与父母关系的重大减少或完全切断相关。

My client, Joe, who was variously misdiagnosed as Schizoid, Asperger’s, and Paranoid, was living alone when he began therapy with me. He was extremely shut down and self-contained but recognized himself as a freeze type from reading articles on my website.

我的客户乔，曾被误诊为分裂型人格障碍、阿斯伯格综合症和偏执型人格障碍，他在开始接受我的治疗时是独自生活的。他非常封闭和自我，但通过阅读我的网站上的文章，他认识到自己是冻结型人格。

Getting him to talk at first was like pulling teeth, but over time I discovered that he was engaged in daily phone contact with his [[null|]]narcissistic, emasculating mother. Through our work and tremendous courage on his part, he gradually reduced the phone contact with his mother: at first to once a week, then once a month, then only major holidays, and after a few years to almost never.

最初让他开口说话就像拔牙一样困难，但渐渐地我发现他每天都会与他的自恋、使男性失去尊严的母亲进行电话联系。通过我们的工作和他巨大的勇气，他逐渐减少了与母亲的电话联系：最初是一周一次，然后是每月一次，然后只有重大节日，几年后几乎不再联系。

When a parent is unrelentingly toxic, hearing even a few words from them can trigger the survivor into an intense emotional flashback. I have worked with numerous clients who made very little progress in their recovery while they maintained contact with the toxic parent\[s\]. For this reason, such clients usually require a parentdectomy to progress. There is a classic book by Bob Hoffman on this topic entitled _Getting Divorced from Mother & Dad._

当一个父母持续有毒时，即使只听到他们的一两句话，也可能让幸存者陷入强烈的情绪闪回。我已与许多客户合作过，他们在与有毒的父母保持联系时，在康复方面进展甚微。因此，这类客户通常需要“父母切除”才能取得进展。鲍勃·霍夫曼有一本关于这个主题的经典书籍，名为《与母亲和父亲离婚》。

As external freedom from “smother-mothering” continued, Joe gradually achieved more and more internal freedom from her. During this time he began to experience the first meaningful relating of his life in an ACA group that for many years provided him with a great deal of positive companionship and relational healing. Joe finally concluded therapy with me when a healthy primary relationship that he formed with a group member reached the two year mark.

随着从“溺爱”中获得的自由感不断延续，乔逐渐从她那里获得了越来越多的内在自由。在这段时间里，他开始在他加入的 ACA 小组中体验到生活中第一次有意义的联系，这个小组多年来为他提供了大量的积极陪伴和关系修复。当乔与小组成员建立的健康主要关系达到两年时，他终于与我结束了治疗。
