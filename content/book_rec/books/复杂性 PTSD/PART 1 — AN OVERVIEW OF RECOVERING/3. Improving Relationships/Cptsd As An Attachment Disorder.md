**Cptsd As An Attachment Disorder  
  
创伤后应激障碍作为一种依恋障碍**

Many therapists see Cptsd as an _attachment disorder_. This means that as a child the survivor grew up without a safe adult to healthily bond with. As bears repeating, Cptsd almost always has emotional neglect at its core. A key outcome of this is that the child has no one in his formative years who models the relational skills that are necessary to create intimacy.  
  
许多治疗师将创伤后应激障碍视为一种依恋障碍。这意味着幸存者在儿童时期成长时没有安全的成年人可以健康地与之建立联系。正如需要反复强调的那样，创伤后应激障碍几乎总是以情感忽视为核心。这一结果的关键是，孩子在成长过程中没有人可以模仿建立亲密关系所需的关系技能。

When the developmental need to practice healthy relating with a caretaker is unmet, survivors typically struggle to find and maintain healthy supportive relationships in their adult lives.  
  
当未能满足与照顾者建立健康关系的成长需求时，幸存者通常难以在成年生活中找到并维持健康支持性的人际关系。
