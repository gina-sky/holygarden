**Reparenting By Committee  
  
委员会代养**

Reparenting at its best is a yin/yang dynamic that balances the mutually enhancing processes of _reparenting by others_ and _self-reparenting_. Reparenting sometimes needs to be initiated and modeled by someone else, such as a therapist, a sponsor, a kind friend or supportive group to show us how to self-reparent ourselves.  
  
最佳的代养是一种阴阳动态，平衡了他人代养和自我代养相互促进的过程。有时，代养需要由其他人发起和示范，比如治疗师、赞助人、善良的朋友或支持性团体，向我们展示如何自我代养。

Alternatively, many survivors instinctively initiate _reparenting by others,_ via entering what one of my clients describes as “the community of books”. They receive reparenting from authors who encourage them to value and support themselves.  
  
或者，许多幸存者本能地通过进入所谓的“书籍社区”来让他人发起再养育，他们从鼓励他们珍视和支持自己的作者那里获得再养育。

Alice was such a survivor. Her family traumatized her during childhood so thoroughly that she quickly learned that being vulnerable around others was dangerous, foolish and totally out of the question. Yet the urge to get the support and the help she was so unfairly deprived of worked its way back into her awareness via a strong attraction to self-help books. By reading a great deal of psychology, she eventually found enough help that she began to think that there might be a kind, safe and helpful person out there in the flesh and entered into some very helpful therapy. \[[15. Bibliotherapy and the Community of Books|Chapter 15]], [[null|]]Bibliotherapy, contains my favorite recommendations for therapeutic self-help books\].  
  
爱丽丝就是这样一位幸存者。她的家庭在童年时给她造成了彻底的创伤，她很快学会了在他人面前表现出脆弱是危险的、愚蠢的，完全不可取。然而，获得她如此不公平地被剥夺的支持和帮助的欲望，通过她对自助书籍的强烈吸引力回到了她的意识中。通过阅读大量的心理学书籍，她最终找到了足够多的帮助，以至于她开始认为在这个世界上可能真的存在一个善良、安全、乐于助人的人，并开始接受一些非常有帮助的治疗。\[第 15 章，阅读疗法，包含了我最喜欢的治疗性自助书籍推荐\]。

I too went through a long gradual process of reading and attending lectures before I was able to take the frightening and embarrassing plunge into therapy, where, as stated earlier, I was fortunate enough to find a good enough therapist to take my relational healing to the next level.  
  
我也经历了一个漫长的逐步过程，通过阅读和参加讲座，才得以勇敢地迈出可怕且尴尬的治疗第一步。正如之前所述，我很幸运地找到了一位足够好的治疗师，将我的关系疗愈提升到下一个层次。

Therapy allowed me to internalize and mimic my therapists’ consistent and reliable stance of being on my side. This in turn led me to gravitate toward safer and more truly intimate friendships. I have seen this same result with numerous clients and friends.  
  
治疗让我内化了模仿治疗师始终支持我的稳定可靠立场。这反过来又使我倾向于更安全和更真正亲密的友谊。我在众多客户和朋友身上看到了同样的结果。

Eventually, I achieved my first earned secure attachment outside of therapy and was subsequently ready to let go of therapy as the only place where I could have deep and meaningful connection.  
  
最终，我在治疗之外实现了我的第一次获得的安全依恋，随后我准备放弃将治疗视为唯一可以建立深刻和有意义联系的地方。

I believe the need to have mothering- and fathering-type support from others is a lifelong need and not just limited to childhood. Fortunately I am now blessed many years later to experience a multileveled form of reparenting by others which I call reparenting by committee. I conceptualize _reparenting by committee_ as a circle of friends that has varying layers and levels of intimacy. The inner circle of my reparenting committee includes my five closest friends.  
  
我相信从他人那里获得类似养育和支持的需求是终身的，而不仅仅局限于童年。幸运的是，多年以后，我有幸体验到一种多层次的由他人提供的再养育形式，我称之为委员会再养育。我把委员会再养育构想为一个拥有不同层次和亲密程度的友谊圈。我再养育委员会的内核包括我的五位最亲密的朋友。

I think of this inner circle as friends with whom nothing is too vulnerable or taboo to talk about. My wife, a therapist friend, my exercise buddy and two members of a long term men’s group that I was in are in this circle. This circle also has an outer layer of people who would be inner if circumstances allowed me to see them more.  
  
我认为这个核心圈层是那些可以谈论任何敏感或禁忌话题的朋友。我的妻子、一位治疗师朋友、我的运动伙伴以及我在的一个长期男性团体中的两位成员都在这个圈层中。这个圈层还有一个外围层，如果条件允许，这些人也可以成为核心成员。

Outside this orb are levels of succeeding less intimate, yet still meaningful circles of relationship. The next circle out is intimates who I rarely see anymore but who have shared enough intimacy with me in the past that I now draw comfort from imagining them caring for me in the present. My deceased grandmother is in this circle as are three of my former therapists, a couple of army buddies, [[null|]]old high school and college friends, and my four best friends from the ten years I lived in Australia.  
  
在这个球体之外，是逐渐外延的、不那么亲密但仍然有意义的社交圈层。下一个圈层是我很少再见到的人，但他们过去与我分享过足够的亲密，现在我想象他们关心我，这让我感到安慰。我的已故祖母就在这个圈层里，还有三位我以前的心理治疗师、几个军队战友、几个老高中和大学朋友，以及我在澳大利亚生活十年期间的四位最好的朋友。

The next circle out from this consists of my nurse practitioner, the body worker I occasionally see, some therapist colleagues and the wise old school librarian who helps me pick books for my son to read.  
  
再往外一层是护士、偶尔见到的身体治疗师、一些治疗师同事，以及那位睿智的老学校图书管理员，她帮我为儿子挑选阅读书籍。

The next circle out from this are friends I play sports with, parents of my son’s friends and people in my neighborhood with whom my contact is not especially vulnerable, but with whom there is an easy chemistry that adds to my general overall sense of belonging.  
  
再往外一层是和我一起运动的朋友、我儿子的朋友的父母，以及我邻居中那些与我接触并不特别脆弱，但与我相处起来很轻松、能增加我归属感的人。

And the final circle is occasional strangers, who from time to time, I am graced to have easy and comforting interactions with.  
  
最外层是偶尔遇到的陌生人，他们时不时地，会让我享受到轻松而舒适的互动。

I also know various survivors whose effective recovery practices have similarly rewarded them with enough portions of love from a variety of others that their childhood starvation for help and support is significantly assuaged. And like me, their committees, started with the first person they had good enough intimacy with. Counting yourself, this then is a committee of two, which with grace can then build slowly, one friendship at a time.  
  
我也认识一些幸存者，他们有效的恢复实践同样使他们从各种人那里获得了足够的爱，极大地缓解了他们童年时期对帮助和支持的渴望。就像我一样，他们的委员会从他们足够亲密的第一个人开始。算上你自己，这便是一个两人的委员会，它可以慢慢地、一次建立一段友谊。
