\*\*The Origin Of Social Anxiety

社交焦虑的起源\*\*

A child who grows up with no reliable human source of love, support and protection typically falls into a great deal of social unease. He “naturally” becomes reluctant to seek support from anyone, and he is forced to adopt self-sufficiency as a survival strategy.

一个在成长过程中没有可靠的人类爱情、支持和保护来源的孩子往往会陷入极大的社交不安。他“自然”地变得不愿意寻求任何人的支持，被迫采取自给自足作为生存策略。

Needing anything from others can feel especially dangerous. The survivor’s innate capacity to experience comfort and support in relationship becomes very limited or non-existent. This is despite the fact that many high functioning survivors learn to socially function quite adequately.

从他人那里寻求任何东西都可能特别危险。幸存者内在体验关系中的舒适和支持的能力变得非常有限或不存在。尽管如此，许多高功能幸存者学会在社会上相当充分地发挥作用。

Unstructured social situations however, like attending parties or just hanging out can be considerably more triggering. Spontaneous self-expression feels like the same setup for disaster that it was in childhood.

这在结构化的情况下尤为如此，因为期望明确，共同的目标将注意力从交谈转移到任务完成上。然而，非结构化的社交场合，如参加聚会或只是闲逛，可能会引发更多的情绪。即兴的自我表达感觉就像童年时一样，是灾难的预兆。

Either way, structured or spontaneous, relating often involves hiding a great deal of anxiety and discomfort. One very successful businessman client of mine told me: “I’m so cool, calm and collected in meetings. A veritable wordsmith with the composure of Michael Caine. I’m a king on the outside, but on the inside I’m a drama queen anguishing in doubt and shame about everything I say or do.”

无论是结构化的还是即兴的，关系往往涉及隐藏大量的焦虑和不舒适。我的一个非常成功的商人客户告诉我：“我在会议上非常酷、冷静和沉着。一个真正的语言大师，拥有迈克尔·凯恩的镇定。我在外面是国王，但在我内心，我是一个在怀疑和羞愧中痛苦挣扎的戏剧女王。”

In worst case scenarios, social anxiety can devolve into social phobia, especially during prolonged flashbacks. Extensive childhood abuse installs a powerful people-are-dangerous program.

在最坏的情况下，社交焦虑可能会演变成社交恐惧症，尤其是在长时间的闪回期间。广泛的童年虐待安装了一个强大的人是危险程序。

When I was at my least recovered, I couldn’t take out the garbage when I was in flashback. I feared that my neighbor – my sweet, always affirming neighbor – would look out the window and see how wretched and pitiful I was. Even worse, I dreaded the prospect that she might come out and want to interact with me.

当我恢复得最差的时候，我在回忆时甚至无法倒垃圾。我害怕我的邻居——我那位温柔、总是给予肯定邻居——会从窗户看到我多么悲惨和可怜。更糟糕的是，我害怕她可能会出来和我互动。

Nonetheless, I socialized for decades when necessary, and seemed to be doing it with a considerable amount of success, no matter how dreadful the reviews were from my critic. I even eventually came to see, when not in flashback, that a lot of people really liked me.

然而，在必要时，我社交了几十年，似乎做得相当成功，不管我的批评者如何评价。甚至在我不是在回忆的时候，我也逐渐意识到，很多人真的喜欢我。

Unfortunately, however, I rarely derived any satisfaction or comfort from this perception, because underneath my smooth persona, I was writhing in discomfort, and typically measuring the time until I could least obtrusively make my escape.

不幸的是，然而，我从这种认知中很少得到任何满足或安慰，因为在我光滑的外表之下，我正痛苦地挣扎，通常在计算我何时可以最不引人注目地逃离。
