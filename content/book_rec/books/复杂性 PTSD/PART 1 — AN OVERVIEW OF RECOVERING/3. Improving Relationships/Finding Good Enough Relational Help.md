**Finding Good Enough Relational Help  
  
寻找足够好的关系帮助**

In [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]], I provide guidance about how to shop for a good enough therapist. I also explore more deeply the principles of _therapeutic relational healing_ to help you know what is reasonable to expect from your therapist.  
  
第 13 章，我提供了关于如何挑选一位足够好的治疗师的建议。我还更深入地探讨了治疗关系疗愈的原则，以帮助您了解从治疗师那里可以合理期待什么。

I have also met a number of survivors who have been lucky enough to get this kind of relational healing from a partner or a friend, typically one who had good enough parents or who “has a lot of recovery”.  
  
我还遇到了一些幸存者，他们很幸运地从伴侣或朋友那里得到了这种关系疗愈，通常是那些有足够好的父母或“有很多恢复”的人。

Finally, attachment theorists have developed the concept of _earned secure attachment_ to describe the _recovered enough state_ where the attachment disorder of Cptsd becomes sufficiently healed. This is typically evidenced by the survivor forming at least one supportive and reliable enough relationship.  
  
最后，依恋理论家们提出了“获得的安全依恋”这一概念，用来描述 Cptsd 的依恋障碍得到足够疗愈的恢复状态。这通常体现在幸存者至少形成了一种支持性和足够可靠的关系。

Many of the successful therapies I have guided come to an end when the client gains an earned secure relationship outside of our therapy. This is typically a partner or best friend with whom the person can truly be themselves.  
  
我指导的许多成功疗法在客户在我们的治疗之外获得了一种获得的安全关系时结束。这通常是一个人们可以真正做自己的伴侣或最好的朋友。

Another potential source of relational healing is the co-counseling relationship. Guidelines for creating a co-counseling relationship are also contained in [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]].  
  
另一个潜在的关系疗愈来源是共同咨询关系。关于创建共同咨询关系的指南也包含在第 13 章中。

Many respondents to my website have reported glowingly about the help they get from others through online recovery groups and forums. These groups can be particularly helpful for those who still find it difficult to be vulnerable in person. Sometimes the distance and relative anonymity of these forums can decrease the fear of [[null|]]self-disclosure, and this in turn can enhance therapeutic relating. An increasing number of therapists also seem to be offering telephone sessions for this same reason.  
  
我的网站上的许多受访者都热情地报告了他们通过在线康复小组和论坛从他人那里获得的帮助。这些小组对于那些仍然觉得在现实生活中难以表现出脆弱的人来说尤其有帮助。有时，这些论坛的距离和相对匿名性可以减少自我披露的恐惧，而这反过来又能增强治疗关系。越来越多的治疗师似乎也在出于同样的原因提供电话咨询。

The section “Finding an online group” in [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]], lists recommended online groups.  
  
第 13 章中的“寻找在线小组”部分列出了推荐的在线小组。
