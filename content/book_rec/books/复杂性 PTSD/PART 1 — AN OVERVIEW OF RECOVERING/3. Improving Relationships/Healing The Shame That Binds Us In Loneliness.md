**Healing The Shame That Binds Us In Loneliness  
  
治愈孤独中的羞耻感**

I soon discovered however, that my tears were as stuck as they had ever been, or at least since I was six – the last time I could remember crying. Further reading and researching then lead me to seek help, and so ensued my baptism into therapy, blessed by the great fortune of finding a good enough therapist on the first try.  
  
然而，我很快发现，我的泪水仍然像以前一样凝固，至少自从我六岁——上一次我能记得哭泣的时候以来。进一步的阅读和研究使我寻求帮助，于是开始了我的治疗洗礼，得益于第一次就找到足够好的治疗师这一巨大的幸运。

[[null|]]This was a milestone achievement for me, and it evolved into a long meandering journey of finding more relational help with an array of healers, therapists, therapeutic groups and deeper friendships. These experiences ranged from extremely helpful to counter-therapeutic, but as time went on they became increasingly helpful.  
  
这是我的一项里程碑式成就，它演变成了一段漫长而曲折的旅程，我在这段旅程中寻求更多与各种治疗师、治疗小组和更深层次的友谊之间的联系。这些经历从极其有益到反治疗，但随着时间的推移，它们变得越来越有益。

A central aspect of the truly helpful relational work was what John Bradshaw called “healing the shame that binds.” I believe toxic shame cannot be healed without some relational help. Several therapists and groups aided me greatly to unbind from the shame that made me hide whenever I could not invoke my perfect persona. Concurrently, I learned that real intimacy correlated with the amount I shared my vulnerabilities. As I increasingly practiced emotional authenticity, the glacier of my lifelong loneliness began to melt.  
  
真正有益的相互关系工作的一个核心方面，正如约翰·布拉德肖所说的“治愈束缚的羞耻”。我相信，没有一些相互关系的帮助，无法治愈有毒的羞耻。几位治疗师和小组极大地帮助我摆脱了让我在无法展现完美形象时隐藏起来的羞耻。同时，我了解到真正的亲密与分享我的脆弱程度相关。随着我越来越多地练习情感的真实性，我终身孤独的冰川开始融化。

It is important to note here that groups can be even more powerful for the healing of shame than individual work. This is because there is typically more _mutual_ vulnerability in a group than in individual work. Moreover, feeling compassion for someone who has suffered similarly to us sometimes naturally expands into feeling the same for ourselves.  
  
在此需要注意的是，对于羞耻感的疗愈，团体比个人工作可能更为有效。这是因为团体中通常比个人工作中存在更多的相互脆弱性。此外，对与我们遭受类似苦难的人表示同情，有时会自然地扩展到对自己表示同样的同情。

Therapeutic relational experiences enhanced my self-compassion considerably further than what I was able to accomplish on my own. Moreover, I believe that insufficient self-compassion is the worst developmental arrest of all, and restored self-compassion is the keystone of all effective recovery.  
  
治疗性的关系体验极大地增强了我的自我同情，这超出了我独自所能取得的成果。此外，我相信，缺乏自我同情是所有发展停滞中最糟糕的，而恢复自我同情是所有有效康复的关键。

In retrospect I can clearly see that as my self-compassion increased, my toxic shame decreased. Modern advances in neuroscience \[see: _A General Theory of Love_\] suggest that we are intrinsically limited in our ability to emotionally regulate and soothe ourselves. More and more research suggests that our ability to metabolize painful emotional states is enhanced by communicating with a safe enough other person.  
  
回顾过去，我可以清楚地看到，随着我的自我同情增加，我的有毒羞耻感减少了。神经科学领域的现代进展\[参见：《爱的普遍理论》\]表明，我们在情感调节和自我安抚的能力上本质上是有限的。越来越多的研究表明，通过与足够安全的人沟通，我们的代谢痛苦情绪状态的能力得到了增强。
