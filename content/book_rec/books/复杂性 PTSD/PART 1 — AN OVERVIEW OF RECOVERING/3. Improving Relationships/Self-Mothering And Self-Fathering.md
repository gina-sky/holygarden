**Self-Mothering And Self-Fathering  
  
自我母亲和自我父亲**

An important, yin/yang dynamic of reparenting involves balancing self-mothering and self-fathering. When a child’s mothering needs are adequately met, self-compassion is installed at the core of her being. When the same is true of her fathering needs, self-protection also becomes deeply imbedded.  
  
再养育的一个重要阴阳动态是平衡自我母亲和自我父亲。当孩子的母亲需求得到充分满足时，自我同情就会在她内心深处扎根。当她的父亲需求同样得到满足时，自我保护也会深深植入。

Self-compassion is the domicile of recovery, and self-protection is its foundation. When self-compassion is sufficiently established as a “home base” to return to in difficult times, an urge to be self-protective naturally arises from it. Living in the world without access to these primal instincts of survival is truly terrifying.  
  
自我同情是康复的居所，自我保护是其基石。当自我同情足够稳固地成为在困难时期回归的“基地”时，由此自然会产生自我保护的欲望。生活在无法接触到这些生存本能的世界中确实令人恐惧。

我们当我们承诺重新成为自己的母亲和父亲时，我们的康复过程将不可估量地前进。我鼓励你现在就承诺成为自己坚定不移的同情和保护者。
