**Self-Mothering Grows Self-Compassion  
  
自我母亲化培养自我同情**

The most essential task of self-mothering is building a deeply felt sense that we are lovable and deserve to be loved. Self-mothering is the practice of loving and accepting the inner child in all phases of his mental, emotional, and physical experience. \[If “inner child” is a problematic concept for any reason, you can imagine nurturing the developmentally arrested part of yourself.\]  
  
自我母亲化的最基本任务是建立一种深深的感觉，即我们可爱，值得被爱。自我母亲化是爱并接受内在孩子在所有心理、情感和身体经历阶段的做法。\[如果“内在孩子”这个概念有任何问题，你可以想象培养自己发展停滞的部分。\]

Self-mothering is based on the precept that unconditional love is every child’s birthright. Recovering from the loss of unconditional love is problematic. Not getting enough of it as children was the greatest loss we had. Sadly, this loss can never be completely remediated, because unconditional love is only appropriate and developmentally helpful during the first two years or so of life.  
  
自我母亲化基于这样的原则：无条件的爱是每个孩子的出生权利。从无条件爱的丧失中恢复过来是有问题的。作为孩子时没有得到足够的它，是我们最大的损失。遗憾的是，这种损失永远无法完全弥补，因为无条件的爱只适用于生命的前两年左右，并且对发展有好处。

After this time, the toddler has to begin to learn that human love comes with some conditions. Although love still needs to be copious at this time, the child must be gently shown that behaviors like hitting, biting and breaking things are not acceptable. The period of conditional love has begun and is successfully guided via a very gradual increase in learning about necessary and healthy limits and rules.  
  
在这段时间后，幼儿必须开始学习人类的爱是有条件的。尽管在这个时候爱仍然需要充足，但孩子必须被温柔地引导，表明打人、咬人和破坏东西等行为是不可接受的。有条件的爱时期已经开始，并且通过非常逐渐地增加了解必要的和健康的界限和规则，得到了成功的引导。

The toddler who receives good enough parenting learns relatively easily to survive the very gradually diminishing supply of unconditional love. During this time she learns little by little that other people also have rights and needs. Her absolute entitlement to gratification is coming to an end, and the needs of her parents will not always be forfeited to accommodate her.  
  
接受足够良好教养的幼儿相对容易地适应无条件爱的供应逐渐减少。在这段时间里，她一点一点地了解到其他人也有权利和需求。她对满足的绝对权利正在结束，父母的需求不会总是为了她而放弃。

[[null|]]Once again, psychological health is based on having about two years of this no questions asked entitlement to unconditional love. It is the normal healthy narcissism that Freud described as “His Majesty the Baby”.  
  
再次强调，心理健康基于大约两年无条件的爱的无条件权利。这是弗洛伊德描述的正常健康的自恋，即“婴儿陛下”。

Serious problems accrue however when the toddler does not begin to learn that there are limits to his original entitlement. If there are no limits for too long, then the journey toward adult narcissism begins. On the other hand, if there are too many limits too soon, the matrix of trauma begins to form.  
  
然而，当幼儿没有开始意识到他的原始权利是有界限的时候，严重的问题就会累积。如果太长时间没有界限，那么通往成人自恋的旅程就开始了。另一方面，如果过早地设定太多界限，创伤的矩阵就开始形成。

Enlightened parents introduce limits slowly but surely. They do it at such a rate that by the time the child reaches adolescence he can balance satisfying his needs with helping his intimates to satisfy theirs. He learns to be sharing and reciprocal, a developmental task that is essential to keeping intimacy alive in his life.  
  
有远见的父母会缓慢但坚定地引入界限。他们以这样的速度进行，以至于当孩子达到青春期时，他能够平衡满足自己的需求与帮助亲密的人满足他们的需求。他学会分享和互惠，这是保持他生活中亲密关系的关键发展任务。

Cptsd is a syndrome of the dearth of unconditional love, or what the great therapist, Carl Rogers, called “unconditional positive regard”. Cptsd can also occur when unconditional love is shut off in an all-or-nothing way in early childhood.  
  
Cptsd 是一种缺乏无条件爱的综合症，或者正如伟大的治疗师卡尔·罗杰斯所说的“无条件积极关注”。Cptsd 也可能发生在童年早期无条件的爱被全有或全无的方式切断的情况下。

Some parents can shower love on babies. But as soon as the child begins toddling around and expressing a will of her own, they become severely punishing and rejecting.  
  
有些父母可以慷慨地给予婴儿爱。但一旦孩子开始蹒跚学步并表达自己的意愿，他们就会变得严厉惩罚和拒绝。
