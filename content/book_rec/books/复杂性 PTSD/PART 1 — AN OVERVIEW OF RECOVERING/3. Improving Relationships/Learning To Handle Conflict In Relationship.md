**Learning To Handle Conflict In Relationship  
  
学习在关系中处理冲突**

One caveat for recovering the ability to authentically be yourself is that it is unreasonable and unfair to expect anyone to accept you if you are being abusively angry or contemptuous. Some trauma survivors flashback into this type of behavior by acting out from their Outer Critic. If this is an issue for you, [[10. Shrinking the Outer Critic|chapter 10]] provides guidance for deconstructing this intimacy-destroying habit.  
  
恢复真诚展现自己的能力有一个注意事项，那就是如果你表现得愤怒或轻蔑，期望任何人接受你是 unreasonable and unfair。一些创伤幸存者会通过 Outer Critic 的行为来重现这种行为。如果你面临这个问题，第 10 章提供了关于分解这种破坏亲密关系的习惯的指导。

In this vein, it is important to note that intimacy does not mean unconditional love. As John Gottman’s scholarly research shows, a certain amount of disagreement, disaffection and disappointment is normal in relationship. The hallmark of successful couples is their ability to handle feelings of anger and hurt in a constructive [[null|]]and civil way. Gottman’s studies have identified this as a key characteristic of couples who still really like each other after ten years.  
  
在这个意义上，重要的是要注意，亲密并不意味着无条件的爱。正如约翰·戈特曼的学术研究所示，在关系中存在一定程度的分歧、不满和失望是正常的。成功伴侣的标志是他们能够以建设性和文明的方式处理愤怒和伤害的感觉。戈特曼的研究将这一点确定为那些在十年后仍然真正喜欢彼此的伴侣的关键特征。

“Tools for Lovingly Resolving Conflict” \[[Toolbox 4. Tools for Lovingly Resolving Conflict|Toolbox 4]] in chapter 16\] is a pragmatic list of techniques and perspectives to help couples resolve disruptions in their mutual attunement. Moreover, books by the Gottmans and Sue Johnson provide a great deal of practical help. I also find that _Beyond The Marriage Fantasy_, by Dan Beaver is especially helpful for men.  
  
“爱的冲突解决工具” \[第 16 章第 4 工具箱\] 是一份实用的技巧和视角列表，帮助夫妻解决彼此调谐中的干扰。此外，戈特曼和苏·约翰逊的书籍提供了大量的实用帮助。我还发现，丹·比弗的《婚姻幻想之外》对男性特别有帮助。
