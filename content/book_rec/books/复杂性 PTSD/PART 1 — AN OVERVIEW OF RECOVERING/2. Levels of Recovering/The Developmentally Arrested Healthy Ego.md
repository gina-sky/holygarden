“Ego”, contrary to popular usage, is not a dirty word. In psychology, the term _ego_ represents what we typically mean when we use terms like my “self” or my identity. The healthy ego is the user friendly manager of the psyche.

“自我”，与普遍用法相反，不是一个肮脏的词。在心理学中，自我这个术语代表了我们使用“我的自我”或“我的身份”等词语时所通常指代的内容。健康的自我是心理的友好管理者。不幸的是，导致创伤后应激障碍的父母通过破坏关键的自爱和保护等自我过程的发展来阻碍自我成长。

They do this by shaming or intimidating you whenever you have a natural impulse to have sympathy for yourself, or stand up for yourself. The instinct to care for yourself and to protect yourself against unfairness is then forced to become dormant.  
  
他们通过在您自然产生同情自己或为自己辩护的冲动时羞辱或恐吓您，从而使您关心自己和保护自己免受不公平待遇的本能被迫进入休眠状态。
