**Key Developmental Arrests In Cptsd  
  
Cptsd 中的关键发展停滞**

What follows is a list of some of the most common developmental arrests that occur in Cptsd. You may find that you experience a diminishment or absence of these key features of healthy human being. Typically, survivors will vary on which and how many of these arrests relate to them. Factors affecting this are your 4F type, your childhood abuse/ neglect pattern, your innate nature and any recovery work that you have already accomplished.

[[null|]]My efforts to nurture myself in these arrested areas of development were limited and spoiled in early recovery by a feeling of resentment. “Why do I have to do this?” was a common internal refrain. Resentment that should have been directed toward my parents often boomeranged onto me and spoiled or thwarted my efforts at self-nurturance.  
  
我在这些发展停滞的领域努力自我培养的努力有限，并且在早期康复期间被一种怨恨感所破坏。“我为什么要做这件事？”成为了一种常见的内心独白。本应针对父母的怨恨往往反弹回我自己，破坏或阻碍了我的自我培养努力。

Thankfully ongoing recovery work helped remedy this resentment. It taught me to practice self-care in a spirit of giving to a child who needed and really deserved to be helped.  
  
幸运的是，持续的康复工作帮助我解决了这种怨恨。它教会我在给予一个需要并真正值得帮助的孩子时的自我关爱精神。

I find it helpful to approach developmental arrests from the viewpoint of novelist David Mitchell’s quip that “…==fire is the sun unwinding itself out of the wood”. Similarly, effective recovery is unwinding the natural potential you were born with out of your unconscious==. This is your innate potential which may be, as yet, unrealized because of your childhood trauma.  
  
我发现从小说家大卫·米切尔的名言“……火是太阳从木头中解脱出来的”的角度来看待发展停滞是有帮助的。同样，有效的康复是从你的无意识中解脱出你与生俱来的自然潜力。这是你的内在潜力，可能因为童年的创伤而尚未实现。

An especially tragic developmental arrest that afflicts many survivors is the loss of their will power and self-motivation. Many dysfunctional parents react destructively to their child’s budding sense of initiative. If this occurs throughout his childhood, the survivor may feel lost and purposeless in his life. He may drift through his whole life rudderless and without a motor.  
  
一种特别悲惨的发展停滞困扰着许多幸存者，那就是他们失去了意志力和自我驱动力。许多功能失调的父母会对孩子萌芽的主动性产生破坏性的反应。如果这种情况贯穿他的童年，幸存者可能会在生活中感到迷茫和毫无目标。他可能一生都在没有舵和引擎的情况下漂泊。

Moreover, even when he manages to identify a goal of his own choosing, he may struggle to follow through with extended and concentrated effort. Remedying this developmental arrest is essential because many new psychological studies now show that _persistence_ – even more than intelligence or innate talent - is the key psychological characteristic necessary for finding fulfillment in life.  
  
此外，即使他设法确定了自己选择的目标，他也可能难以持续并集中精力去实现它。纠正这种发展停滞是至关重要的，因为许多新的心理学研究表明，坚持——甚至比智力或天赋——是找到生活中满足感的关键心理特征。

I have worked with many survivors stranded in this form of adult helplessness. Those who recover from it typically do so by engaging extensively in the angering work of grieving that is discussed [[null|]]throughout this book. The ability to invoke willpower seems to be allied to your ability to healthily express your anger. With sufficient recovering, you can learn to manufacture your volition. In the beginning you can fake it until you make it. This is what Stephen Johnson calls “the hard work miracle.”  
  
我曾在成人无助这种形式中与许多幸存者合作过。那些从这种状态中恢复过来的人通常是通过参与这本书中讨论的愤怒的悲伤工作来实现的。似乎召唤意志力的能力与您健康表达愤怒的能力有关。在足够的恢复之后，您可以学会制造自己的意志。一开始，您可以假装直到做到。这就是斯蒂芬·约翰逊所说的“艰苦工作的奇迹”。

What follows is a concluding comment about development arrests. Some survivors have confidence but not self-esteem. In childhood, my own flight response got channeled into acquiring academic skills for which the outside world rewarded me. But the benefit of these rewards never penetrated my toxic shame enough to allow me to feel that I was a worthwhile person.  
  
以下是对发展停滞的总结性评论。一些幸存者有信心但没有自尊。在童年时期，我自己的逃避反应被引导到获取学术技能上，这些技能得到了外界的奖励。但这些奖励的好处从未足够渗透我的有毒羞愧，让我觉得自己是一个有价值的人。

My critic, like my parents, always found something flawed in me to contradict the feedback that I was getting. Ninety-nine percent on a test was never a cause for pride. Rather, it was the impetus for a great deal of self-criticism about the missing one percent. Like many other survivors that I have worked with, I developed the _imposter’s syndrome_. This syndrome contradicted the outside positive feedback that I was receiving. It insisted that if people really knew me, they would see what a loser I was. Eventually, however, I became confident in my intelligence even though my self-esteem was still abysmal.  
  
我的批评家，就像我的父母一样，总是能在我身上找到一些缺陷来反驳我所收到的反馈。考试得 99 分从未是值得骄傲的理由。相反，它激发了我对那缺失的 1%进行大量自我批评。就像我与其他许多幸存者一样，我患上了冒充者综合症。这种综合症与我所收到的外界积极反馈相矛盾。它坚持认为，如果人们真正了解我，他们会看到我有多失败。然而，最终，尽管我的自尊心仍然很低落，但我对自己的智力变得自信。
