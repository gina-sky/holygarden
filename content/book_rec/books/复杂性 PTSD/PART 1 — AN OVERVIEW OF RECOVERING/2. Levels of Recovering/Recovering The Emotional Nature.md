**Recovering The Emotional Nature  
  
恢复情感天性**

This section is an updated version of an article I wrote in 1991. I originally wrote it as a prelude to my first book, _The Tao of Fully Feeling_, and it was written as an appeal to the general public to understand the consequences of trying to sanitize one’s emotions. Thankfully, the response I received encouraged me to complete that book, which is a guide to overcoming the familial and societal damage meted out on children’s emotional life.  
  
本节是我在 1991 年撰写的一篇文章的更新版本。我最初将其作为我的第一本书《全然感受的道》的序言，并作为对公众的呼吁，以理解试图净化自己情感后果。幸运的是，我收到的回应鼓励我完成那本书，这是一本指导如何克服对儿童情感生活造成的家庭和社会伤害的指南。

The survivor, who is seeking a healthy relationship with his emotional being, will strive to accept the existential fact that the human feeling nature is often contradictory and frequently vacillates between opposite polarities of feeling experiences. It is quite normal for feelings to change unpredictably along continuums that stretch between a variety of emotional polarities. As such, it is especially human and healthy to have shifts of mood between such extremes as happy and sad, enthused and depressed, loving and angry, trusting and suspicious, brave and afraid, and forgiving and blaming.  
  
幸存者，在寻求与自己的情感保持健康关系的过程中，会努力接受这样一个存在主义事实：人类的情感性质往往是矛盾的，经常在相反的情感体验极性之间摇摆不定。情感在介于各种情感极性之间的连续体上不可预测地变化是很正常的。因此，在快乐和悲伤、兴奋和沮丧、爱和愤怒、信任和怀疑、勇敢和害怕、宽恕和责备等极端情绪之间情绪波动，特别符合人类的健康需求。

Unfortunately, in this culture only the “positive” polarity of any emotional experience is approved or allowed. This can cause such an avoidance of the “negative” polarity, that at least two different painful conditions result.  
  
很遗憾，在这个文化中，只有任何情感体验的“积极”极性被认可或允许。这可能导致对“消极”极性的回避，从而至少产生两种不同的痛苦状况。

In the first, the person injures and exhausts himself in compulsive attempts to avoid a disavowed feeling, and actually becomes more stuck in it. This is like the archetypal clown whose frantic efforts to free himself from a piece of fly paper, leave him more immobilized and entangled.  
  
在第一种情况下，人们通过强迫自己避免一种被否认的感觉而伤害和耗尽自己，实际上却更加陷入其中。这就像典型的小丑，他疯狂地试图从一张粘蝇纸上解脱出来，结果却让自己更加无法动弹和纠缠。

In the second, repression of one end of the emotional continuum often leads to a repression of the whole continuum, and the person becomes emotionally deadened. The baby of emotional vitality is thrown out with the bathwater of some unacceptable feeling.  
  
在第二点，对情感连续体一端的压抑往往导致整个连续体的压抑，个人变得情感麻木。情感活力的婴儿随着一些不可接受的感觉的洗澡水被扔掉了。

A reluctance to participate in such a fundamental realm of the human experience results in much unnecessary loss. For just as [[null|]]without night there is no day, without work there is no play, without hunger there is no satiation, without fear there is no courage, without tears there is no joy, and without anger, there is no real love.  
  
不愿意参与这样一个人类经验的基本领域会导致许多不必要的损失。因为正如没有夜晚就没有白天，没有工作就没有娱乐，没有饥饿就没有满足，没有恐惧就没有勇气，没有眼泪就没有快乐，没有愤怒就没有真正的爱。

Most people, who choose or are coerced into only identifying with “positive” feelings, usually wind up in an emotionally lifeless middle ground – bland, deadened, and dissociated in an unemotional “no-man’s-land.”  
  
大多数选择或被迫只认同“积极”感受的人，通常最终陷入一个情感死寂的中立地带——平淡、麻木，在一个无情的“无人之地”中分离。

Moreover, when a person tries to hold onto a preferred feeling for longer than its actual tenure, she often appears as unnatural and phony as ersatz grass or plastic flowers. If instead, she learns to surrender willingly to the normal human experience that good feelings always ebb and flow, she will eventually be graced with a growing ability to renew herself in the vital waters of emotional flexibility.  
  
此外，当一个人试图长时间维持一种偏好的感觉，而超过其实际应有的时间，她往往会显得像人造草或塑料花一样不自然和虚假。相反，如果她学会自愿地接受正常的人类体验，即好的感觉总是起伏不定，她最终将获得在情感灵活性的生命之水中不断自我更新的能力。

The repression of the so-called negative polarities of emotion causes much unnecessary pain, as well as the loss of many essential aspects of the feeling nature. In fact, much of the plethora of loneliness, alienation, and addictive distraction that plagues modern industrial societies is a result of people being taught and forced to reject, pathologize or punish so many of their own and others’ normal feeling states.  
  
压抑所谓的负面情绪极性会导致许多不必要的痛苦，以及失去许多感觉本质的基本方面。事实上，许多困扰现代工业社会的孤独、疏离和成瘾性分心的现象，是人们被教导和被迫拒绝、病理化或惩罚自己和他人的许多正常情感状态的结果。

Nowhere, not in the deepest recesses of the self, or in the presence of his closest friends, is the average person allowed to have and explore any number of normal emotional states. Anger, depression, envy, sadness, fear, distrust, etc., are all as normal a part of life as bread and flowers and streets. Yet, they have become ubiquitously avoided and shameful human experiences.  
  
现在，无论在自我最深的角落，还是在最亲密的朋友面前，普通人都不被允许拥有和探索任何数量的正常情感状态。愤怒、抑郁、嫉妒、悲伤、恐惧、不信任等，都是生活中像面包、花朵和街道一样正常的一部分。然而，它们已经变成了普遍避免和羞耻的人类经历。

How tragic this is, for all of these emotions have enormously important and healthy functions in a wholly integrated psyche. One dimension where this is most true is in the arena of healthy self-protection. For without access to our uncomfortable or painful feelings, we are deprived of the most fundamental part of our ability to notice when something is unfair, abusive, or neglectful in our environments.  
  
这是多么悲惨，因为所有这些情绪在完全整合的心理中都具有极其重要和健康的机能。其中最真实的一个维度是在健康自我保护领域。因为没有接触到我们不舒服或痛苦的感受，我们就失去了注意到在我们环境中有什么是不公平、虐待或忽视的最基本能力。

[[null|]]Those who cannot feel their sadness often do not know when they are being unfairly excluded, and those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in danger of putting up with it without protest.  
  
那些无法感受到自己悲伤的人往往不知道自己何时被不公平地排斥，而那些无法感受到自己正常的愤怒或恐惧反应来对抗虐待的人，常常面临忍受它而不抗议的危险。

Perhaps never before has humankind been so alienated from so many of its normal feeling states, as it is in the twenty-first century. Never before have so many human beings been so emotionally deadened and impoverished.  
  
或许人类从未像在 21 世纪这样，与自己的许多正常情感状态如此疏远。从未有如此多的人情感麻木和贫乏。

The disease of emotional emaciation is epidemic. Its effects on health are often euphemistically labeled as stress, and like the emotions, stress is often treated like some unwanted waste that must be removed.  
  
情感枯竭的疾病是普遍的。它对健康的影响通常被委婉地称为压力，就像情感一样，压力常常被当作一些不想要的废物，必须被清除。

Until all of the emotions are accepted indiscriminately (and acceptance does not imply license to dump emotions irresponsibly or abusively), there can be no wholeness, no real sense of well being, and no solid sense of self esteem. Thus, while it may be fairly easy to like yourself when feelings of love or happiness or serenity are present, deeper psychological health is seen only when you can maintain a posture of self-love and self-respect in the times of emotional hurt that accompany life’s inevitable contingencies of loss, loneliness, confusion, uncontrollable unfairness, and accidental mistake.  
  
除非所有情感都被无差别地接受（接受并不意味着可以不负责任或滥用地发泄情感），否则不可能有完整性，没有真正的幸福感，也没有稳固的自尊感。因此，虽然当存在爱、快乐或平静的感觉时，喜欢自己可能相当容易，但更深层次的心理健康只有在你能维持自我爱护和自尊的姿态，在伴随生活不可避免的不幸、孤独、困惑、无法控制的不公平和意外错误等情感痛苦时刻，才能体现出来。

The human feeling experience, much like the weather, is often unpredictably changeable. No “positive” feeling can be induced to persist as a permanent experience, no matter what Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy tells us. As disappointing as this may be, as much as we might like to deny it, as much as it causes each of us ongoing life frustration, and as much as we were raised and continue to be reinforced for trying to control and pick our feelings, they are still by definition of the human condition, largely outside the province of our wills.  
  
人的情感体验，就像天气一样，常常是不可预测地变化无常。无论认知行为疗法告诉我们什么，都无法让任何“积极的”感觉持久地成为永久体验。尽管这可能会让人失望，尽管我们可能不愿意承认，尽管这给每个人带来持续的生活挫折，尽管我们从小就被培养并继续被强化去控制和挑选我们的情感，但根据人类条件的定义，它们在很大程度上仍然超出了我们意志的范围。
