**Cptsd And Somatic Therapy  
  
创伤后应激障碍和躯体治疗**

There are also various somatic therapies that can help our bodies heal. As with my earlier comments about CBT, I encourage you to be wary of somatic approaches that claim to heal Cptsd without working on the cognitive and emotional levels described above. Some approaches, in fact, blanketly dismiss cognitive work in a way that sidesteps the crucial work of shrinking the inner critic. Some approaches also believe that their techniques eliminate the fundamental necessity of grieving the losses of childhood, and understanding how abusive and negligent parenting is at the root of our problems.  
  
也有各种身体疗法可以帮助我们的身体恢复。正如我之前关于认知行为疗法（CBT）的评论，我鼓励您对那些声称无需在上述认知和情感层面上工作就能治愈创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的身体疗法持谨慎态度。实际上，一些方法完全忽视了认知工作，以回避缩小内心批评者的关键工作。一些方法还认为，他们的技术消除了哀悼童年损失的基本必要性，以及理解虐待和疏忽的育儿方式是我们问题的根源。

Nonetheless, some somatic therapists can ease the physiological traumas that are locked in our bodies, as long as the practitioner is not actively dismissing or impeding the client’s cognitive and emotional work.  
  
尽管如此，一些躯体治疗师可以缓解我们身体中锁存的生理创伤，只要从业者不是积极地忽视或阻碍客户的认知和情感工作。

In this vein, it is my opinion that techniques like EMDR \[Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing\] and Somatic Experiencing are very powerful tools for stress-reduction. They are especially helpful in resolving simple ptsd. However, they are not complete Cptsd therapies, unless the practitioner is eclectic enough to be incorporating inner critic and grieving-the-losses-of-childhood work.  
  
在这点上，我认为像 EMDR（眼动脱敏再加工）和身体体验这样的技术是减压的非常有力的工具。它们在解决简单的 PTSD（创伤后应激障碍）方面特别有帮助。然而，除非从业者足够博学，能够结合内在批评和童年损失哀悼的工作，否则它们并不是完整的 Cptsd 治疗方法。

Other helpful somatic techniques include Rosen Work, Rolfing, Rebirthing and Reichian work. These techniques can also be very helpful in aiding the recovery of the ability to therapeutically emote both tears and anger.  
  
其他有助于身体的技巧包括罗森工作、罗尔夫技术、重生和赖希工作。这些技巧也有助于恢复治疗性表达泪水和愤怒的能力。

[[null|]]For survivors of physical and/or sexual abuse, I believe Rosen Work is especially helpful. I found that Rosen Work’s emphasis on soft touch helped heal my Cptsd startle response to physical touch. A _startle response_ is the sudden full body-flinching that survivors experience at loud noises or unanticipated physical contact. This is usually a somatic flashback to previous abuses. In my case, the startle response was installed in me by my parents through frequent face-slapping. As a lap-swimmer in public pools, it has taken me ages to significantly reduce being triggered by the hand and arm movements of people who swim alongside me.  
  
对于遭受身体和/或性虐待的幸存者，我认为罗森工作特别有帮助。我发现罗森工作对轻柔触摸的强调帮助我治愈了对身体接触的 Cptsd 惊跳反应。惊跳反应是幸存者在听到巨大噪音或未预料到的身体接触时突然全身颤抖。这通常是对先前虐待的身体性闪回。在我的情况下，惊跳反应是由我的父母通过频繁的脸部打巴掌植入我的。作为一个在公共游泳池中游泳的仰泳者，我花了很长时间才显著减少被与我并肩游泳的人的手臂和手部动作所触发。

I also had to shop around to find a Rosen worker who welcomed my use of the verbal ventilation process. Some practitioners prefer to work in silence, and this limits or eliminates the therapeutic benefit to most survivors.  
  
我也不得不四处寻找，找到一个欢迎我使用口头宣泄过程的罗森员工。一些从业者更喜欢在沉默中工作，这限制了或消除了对大多数幸存者的治疗益处。

It is also important to emphasize here that somatic therapies can be especially helpful in healing the anxiety reaction to touch and physical closeness that many survivors of physical or sexual abuse experience. Exceptions to this are the survivors that I have met who have experienced remediation of this symptom through the help of an especially kind and safe partner.  
  
在此也要强调，身体疗法对于治疗许多遭受身体或性侵犯的幸存者所经历的触摸和身体亲近感焦虑反应特别有帮助。例外的是，我遇到的一些幸存者通过一位特别善良和安全的伴侣的帮助，已经缓解了这种症状。
