\*\*Self-Medication

自我用药\*\*

For those who have been repeatedly unsuccessful at stopping or reducing the use of non-therapeutic medications and substances, Gabor Mate’s work on harm reduction may be helpful. Drug and alcohol recovery is beyond the scope of this book, but if you are stuck in habits of self-medication that are not allowing you to progress in your Cptsd recovery, I encourage you to get help from a substance abuse recovery program or from Twelve Step programs like Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous.

对于那些反复尝试却无法停止或减少使用非治疗性药物和物质的人来说，加博尔·马特的关于减少伤害的工作可能有所帮助。药物和酒精康复超出了本书的范围，但如果你在自我治疗的习惯中陷入困境，无法在 Cptsd 康复中取得进展，我鼓励你寻求物质滥用康复项目或类似酗酒者或药物滥用者匿名会的十二步程序的帮助。
