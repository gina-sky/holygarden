\*\*The Role Of Medication

药物的作用\*\*

As a psychotherapist, I am not authorized to give pharmaceutical advice, but I have frequently noticed that survivors who need pharmaceutical help seem to benefit most from SSRI anti-depressants. Taken at the right dosage SSRI’s do not usually blunt your affect in a way that makes grieving impossible. Moreover, if your critic does not budge with extended critic-shrinking work, SSRI’s can usually reduce its volume and vitriol enough so that you can effectively shrink it. Once it is diminished enough, you can dispense with medication. One caveat here is that unless you do extensive critic shrinking work, the critic will be as strong as ever when the medications wear off.

作为一名心理治疗师，我无权提供药物建议，但我经常注意到，需要药物帮助的幸存者似乎从选择性 5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）抗抑郁药中获益最大。在正确的剂量下，SSRI 通常不会以使哀悼变得不可能的方式钝化你的情感。此外，如果你的批评者通过扩展的批评缩小工作仍未改变，SSRI 通常可以足够减少其音量和恶意，以便你有效地缩小它。一旦它减少到足够程度，你就可以停止用药。这里的一个注意事项是，除非你进行广泛的批评缩小工作，否则当药物失效时，批评者将和以前一样强大。
