**Grieving And Verbal Ventilation  
  
哀悼与言语宣泄**

Grieving restores our crucial, developmentally arrested capacity to verbally ventilate. _Verbal ventilation_ is the penultimate grieving practice. It is speaking from your feelings in a way that releases and resolves your emotional distress.  
  
悲伤恢复了我们至关重要的、发展停滞的口头宣泄能力。口头宣泄是悲伤的最后一项实践。它是以一种释放和解决你情感痛苦的方式表达你的感受。

I believe the following description of a six panel cartoon visually conveys the powerful transformative power of verbal ventilation. In the first panel of the wordless cartoon, a woman with a dark cloud over her head is talking to a friend who has a shining sun over hers. In panel two, as the first woman gestures in a way that indicates complaining, the cloud covers her friend’s sun. In panel three, the cloud emits a bolt of lightning, as she angrily purges, and her friend glowers along with her. In panel four, the cloud rains on them as they embrace, commiserating in the rain of their shared tears. In panel 5, relief spreads over their faces as the cloud moves away from the sun. In panel 6 the sun shines over both of them, as they smile and slip into pleasant conversation.  
  
我相信以下对六格漫画的描述，从视觉上传达了口头宣泄强大的转化力量。在无声漫画的第一格中，一个头顶乌云的女子正在和一个头顶灿烂阳光的朋友说话。在第二格中，当第一个女子以表示抱怨的方式比划时，乌云笼罩了她的朋友阳光。在第三格中，乌云发出一道闪电，当她愤怒地发泄时，她的朋友也和她一起怒视。在第四格中，乌云在拥抱中降雨，他们共同在泪水中哀悼。在第五格中，随着乌云从阳光中移开，他们的脸上露出了宽慰的表情。在第六格中，阳光照耀着他们，他们微笑着陷入愉快的交谈。

这幅卡通反映了言语宣泄的完全实现力量，这是亲密关系中的关键联结过程。它也是有效治疗的关键治愈过程，以下是一个治疗过程中言语宣泄的例子。

A client arrives flashbacked and in pain. He verbally ventilates about it. He is the regressed hurt child, feeling bad, and part of him is sad and part of him is mad. He is once again lost in the painful feelings of his original abandonment, and this state is like a death that responds well to grieving.  
  
一位客户带着闪回和痛苦来到。他对此进行了言语宣泄。他是退行的受伤的孩子，感到不好，他的一部分感到悲伤，另一部分感到愤怒。他再次陷入原始遗弃的痛苦感受中，这种状态就像一种对哀悼反应良好的死亡。

As he lets his feelings come into his voice, he talks, cries and angers out his pain. Through this processing of his pain, he then gradually moves out of his flashback. He is restored to his normal everyday sense that he is no longer trapped in his traumatic childhood. Relief about this returns him to his normal ability to cope. If his grieving is deep enough, he customarily feels more hopeful and lighthearted. Not infrequently, his sense of humor resurfaces, and laughter punctuates his continuing verbal ventilation. This laughter is usually much different than the sarcastic, self-bullying humor of his critic that he might have begun the session with.  
  
当他让情感融入自己的声音时，他谈话、哭泣和愤怒地表达出他的痛苦。通过这个过程处理他的痛苦，他逐渐从回忆中走出来。他恢复了正常的生活感觉，不再被困在创伤性的童年中。对此的释怀让他恢复了应对正常生活的能力。如果他的悲伤足够深，他通常会感到更加乐观和轻松。他的幽默感不时地浮现出来，笑声点缀着他持续的言语宣泄。这种笑声通常与他开始会话时批评者那种讽刺、自我折磨的幽默截然不同。

The inner critic is sometimes so hostile to grieving that shrinking the critic may need to be your first recovery priority. Until the critic is sufficiently tamed, grieving can actually make flashbacks worse, rather than perform the restorative processes it alone can initiate.  
  
内心的批评者有时对悲伤如此敌对，以至于缩小批评者可能需要成为你首要的康复目标。直到批评者被充分驯服，悲伤实际上可能会使回忆变得更糟，而不是像它单独能启动的修复过程那样。

I have worked with numerous clients who were so traumatized around grieving that we needed to spend many months working on the cognitive level before grieving was released from the spoiling effects of the toxic critic. [[11. Grieving|Chapter 11]] provides a great deal of practical guidance for restoring your ability to grieve.  
  
我与许多客户合作过，他们在悲伤方面受到了极大的创伤，我们需要花费数月时间在认知层面上进行工作，才能使悲伤摆脱有毒批评的破坏性影响。第 11 章提供了大量实用指导，以恢复你悲伤的能力。
