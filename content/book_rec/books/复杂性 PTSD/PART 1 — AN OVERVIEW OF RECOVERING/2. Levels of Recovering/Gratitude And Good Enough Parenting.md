\*\*Gratitude And Good Enough Parenting

感激与足够好的育儿\*\*

When developing children receive “good enough parenting”, they feel that life is a gift even though it typically comes with difficult and painful experiences.

当孩子在成长过程中得到“足够好的育儿”时，他们会感觉到生活是一份礼物，尽管它通常伴随着困难和痛苦的经历。

The term _good enough parenting_ derives from the work of renowned adult and child psychologist, D.W. Winnicott, who coined the term “good enough mothering” to describe his observation that children do not need parents to be perfect. He noticed through his long career that children grew up with their self-esteem and capacity for intimacy intact when their parents were reasonably consistent with their love and support.

“足够好”的育儿方式源自著名成人及儿童心理学家 D.W.温尼科特的工作，他创造了“足够好的母亲”这一术语，用以描述他的观察：孩子并不需要父母完美。在他的长期职业生涯中，他注意到，当父母在爱和支援上保持合理的一致性时，孩子们在成长过程中保持了自尊和亲密关系的潜力。

Nowadays, many therapists attach the phrase “good enough” to concepts like friend, partner, therapist or person. This is usually done to deconstruct perfectionistic expectations of relationships [[null|]]\- expectations that are so unrealistic that they are destructive to essentially worthwhile relationships.

如今，许多治疗师将“足够好”这个短语与朋友、伴侣、治疗师或人等概念联系起来。这通常是为了解构对关系的完美主义期望——这些期望如此不切实际，以至于它们对本质上值得的关系具有破坏性。

When I apply the concept of “good enough” to people, I generally mean that a person is essentially good hearted, tries to be fair, and meets his or her commitments a large portion of the time.

当我将“足够好”的概念应用于人时，我通常是指一个人本质上是善良的，努力做到公平，并且大部分时间都能履行自己的承诺。

I also like to apply “good enough” to other concepts such as a good enough job, a good enough try, a good enough outing, a good enough day or a good enough life. I apply this concept liberally to contradict the black-and-white, all-or none thinking of the critic which reflexively judges people and things as defective unless they are perfect.

我也喜欢将“足够好”这个概念应用到其他方面，比如足够好的工作、足够好的尝试、足够好的外出、足够好的日子或足够好的生活。我广泛地应用这个概念来反驳批评者的黑白、全有或全无的思维，他们无意识地评判人和事物，除非完美，否则就视为有缺陷。

Good enough parents provide generous amounts of support, protection and comforting. They also guide their children to deal constructively with recurring existential difficulties such as loss, real villains, painful world events and normal disappointments with friends and family.

足够好的父母提供慷慨的支持、保护和安慰。他们还指导孩子以建设性的方式处理反复出现的存在主义困难，如失落、真正的恶棍、痛苦的世界事件以及与朋友和家人的正常失望。

Most importantly, they model how disappointments with intimates can be repaired. A key way they do this is to easily forgive their children for normal mistakes and shortcomings.

最重要的是，他们以身作则，展示如何修复与亲密的人之间的失望。他们做到这一点的一个关键方式是轻易原谅孩子犯的正常错误和缺点。

Children who receive good enough parenting easily recognize and protect themselves from bullying and exploitive people because they do not have to become accustomed to being treated unfairly.

接受足够好教育的孩子容易识别并保护自己免受欺凌和剥削，因为他们不必习惯于受到不公平的对待。

Growing up in a safe and loving enough family naturally enhances the child’s capacity to notice and enjoy the many gifts that life also brings. He learns that there is enough good in life to significantly outweigh its necessary losses and travails.

在安全、充满爱的家庭中长大自然能增强孩子发现并享受生活中带来的许多礼物。他了解到生活中有足够的好，足以显著超过其必要的损失和磨难。

In the traumatizing family however, there is little or nothing that is good enough and hence little for which to be grateful. The child instead is forced to over-develop a critic that hyper-focuses on what is dangerously imperfect in her as well as others. This sometimes [[null|]]helps her to hide aspects of herself that might be punished. It may further assist her to avoid people who might be punishing.

然而，在创伤性的家庭中，几乎没有什么足够好的东西，因此几乎没有值得感激的东西。孩子被迫过度发展一个批评家，这个批评家过度关注她自己和他人危险的不完美之处。这有时有助于她隐藏可能受到惩罚的自我方面。这还可能帮助她避免可能惩罚她的人。

Unfortunately, years of this habituates the child into _only_ seeing herself, life and others in a negative light. Consequently, when she grows up and becomes free of her truly harmful family, she cannot see that life offers her many new possibilities. Her ability to see the good in herself and certain safe enough others remains developmentally arrested.

不幸的是，多年的这种习惯使孩子习惯于只以消极的眼光看待自己、生活和他人。因此，当她长大后，摆脱了真正有害的家庭，她看不到生活为她提供了许多新的可能性。她看到自己和他人的优点的能力在发展上停滞不前。

The cultivation of gratitude requires a balanced perspective. You can learn to see and appreciate the good in life without giving up your ability to discern what is truly negative and unacceptable in the present.

感恩的培养需要平衡的视角。你可以学会看到并欣赏生活中的美好，同时不放弃辨别真正消极和不可接受的事物的能力。
