\*\*Psychoeducation And Cognitive Healing

心理教育与认知疗愈\*\*

Becoming psychoeducated about Cptsd is the first level of addressing this poisonous indoctrination of your mind against your healthy ego. When you intricately understand how antagonistic your parents were to your healthy sense of self, you become more motivated to engage in the self-help processes of rectifying their damage. The more you identify their damage the more you know what to fix.

了解创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的心理教育是解决这种对你健康自我的有害洗脑的第一步。当你深入理解你的父母是如何与你健康的自我感作对的，你就会更有动力参与自我帮助过程，修复他们的伤害。你越能识别他们的伤害，就越清楚该修复什么。

<span style="background:#affad1">This is essential because without a properly functioning ego, you have no center for making healthy choices and decisions. All too often, your decisions are based on the fear of getting in trouble or getting abandoned, rather than on the principles of having meaningful and equitable interactions with the world. </span>

这是至关重要的，因为没有正常运作的自我，你就没有做出健康选择和决策的中心。过于常见的是，你的决定是基于避免麻烦或被遗弃的恐惧，而不是基于与世界进行有意义的和公平互动的原则。

You can learn to gradually replace the critic’s toxic perspective with a viewpoint that supports you in your life, and that stops you from unnecessarily scaring yourself.

你可以学会逐渐用支持你生活的观点取代批评者的有毒视角，并阻止你无谓地吓到自己。

You are free now as an adult to develop peace of mind and a supportive relationship with yourself. A self-championing stance can transform your existence from struggling survival to a fulfilling sense of thriving.

你现在作为一个成年人，可以自由地培养内心的平和与自我支持的关系。自我倡导的态度可以将你的生活从挣扎求生的状态转变为充满活力的满足感。

You can begin right now by inviting your instincts of self-compassion and self-protection to awaken and bloom in your life.

你可以立即开始，通过邀请你的自我同情和自我保护的直觉在你的生活中觉醒并绽放。

Cognitive healing may have begun or been reinforced by reading what has preceded this. Hopefully you are having some epiphanies about what is at the core of your suffering.

通过阅读前面的内容，认知疗愈可能已经开始或得到加强。希望你在思考你痛苦的根源时有所领悟。

Some readers may have been searching for cognitive answers for years, and through their reading and therapy already created a sizable foundation for doing this work.

一些读者可能已经寻找了多年的认知答案，通过阅读和疗法，他们已经为这项工作建立了一个坚实的基础。

At the same time, those who have only tried a Cognitive-Behavioral Approach \[CBT\] to healing their trauma may feel great [[null|]]resistance to hearing that cognitive work is important. If you are like me, you may have been introduced to it in a way that promised more than could be delivered. Cognitive tools are irreplaceable in healing cognitive issues, but they do not address all the levels of our wounding. They are especially limited in addressing emotional issues, as we will see below.

同时，那些只尝试过认知行为疗法（CBT）来治疗创伤的人可能会对听到认知工作很重要感到极大的抵触。如果你像我一样，你可能被介绍的方式承诺了无法实现的东西。认知工具在治疗认知问题上是不可替代的，但它们并不能解决我们创伤的所有层面。正如我们下面将要看到的，它们在处理情绪问题方面尤其有限。

In early recovery, the psychoeducation piece of cognitive work typically comes from the wisdom of others: teachers, writers, friends and therapists who are more informed on this subject than we are. When psychoeducation reaches its most powerful level of effectiveness, however, it begins to morph into mindfulness.

在早期康复阶段，认知工作的心理教育部分通常来自他人的智慧：比我们更了解这一主题的教师、作家、朋友和治疗师。然而，当心理教育达到其最有效的水平时，它开始转变为正念。
