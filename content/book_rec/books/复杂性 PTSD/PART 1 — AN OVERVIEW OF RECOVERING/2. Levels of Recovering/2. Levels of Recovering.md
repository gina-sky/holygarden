LEVELS OF RECOVERING

恢复级别

Healing from Complex PTSD is, above all, complex. This is important to emphasize because there are numerous one dimensional approaches to trauma that bill themselves as cure-alls. In my opinion, however, singular approaches are unable to address all the levels of wounding that combine to cause Cptsd.

从复杂型 PTSD 中恢复，首先是一个复杂的过程。这一点很重要，因为有许多针对创伤的一维方法自诩为万能的疗法。然而，在我看来，单一的方法无法解决导致 PTSD 的所有伤害级别。

Moreover, working with simplistic approaches can leave you stranded in toxic shame when you do not achieve the touted results. I was motivated to write this book in large part because of the many times I sank into new levels of self-contempt when the latest panacea therapy did not cure me.

此外，使用简单的方法可能会在你没有达到吹嘘的效果时，让你陷入有毒的羞愧之中。我之所以写这本书，很大程度上是因为我在尝试最新的万能疗法却未能治愈自己的时候，多次陷入了新的自我厌恶之中。

I will use the word “key” repeatedly to describe the various tasks upon which recovering hinges. This book offers a keychain of perspectives and techniques to unlock yourself from being what Alice Miller called a “Prisoner of Childhood.”

我将反复使用“关键”这个词来描述恢复过程中至关重要的各种任务。这本书提供了一系列视角和技术，帮助你从艾丽丝·米勒所说的“童年的囚犯”中解放出来。

Abusive and abandoning parents can injure and abandon us on many levels: cognitive, emotional, spiritual, physical and relational. [[null|]]==To recover, you need to learn how to support yourself – to meet your unmet developmental needs on each level that is relevant to your experience of childhood trauma. ==

虐待和遗弃父母可以在认知、情感、精神、身体和关系等多个层面上伤害和遗弃我们。为了恢复，你需要学会如何支持自己——满足你在童年创伤经历中每个相关层面的未满足的发展需求。

This chapter is a brief overview of the many tasks involved in Cptsd recovery. These tasks are explored at greater length in Part II. The comprehensive Table of Contents at the beginning of this book will direct you to further information on each of the topics covered in this chapter. Please allow yourself to also use the Table of Contents to explore sections of the book that peak your interest.

本章简要概述了 Cptsd 恢复过程中涉及到的许多任务。这些任务在第二部分有更详细的探讨。本书开头的完整目录将引导你了解本章涵盖的每个主题的更多信息。请允许你自己也使用目录来探索那些引起你兴趣的章节。
