**SOMATIC HEALING  
  
身心疗愈**

Trauma takes its toll on the body in many ways. We need to comprehend the physical damage that Cptsd wreaks on our bodies to motivate us to adopt practices that help us to heal on this level.  
  
创伤以多种方式对身体造成伤害。我们需要理解创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）对我们身体造成的身体损伤，以激励我们采取有助于我们在这一层面疗愈的实践。

Most of the physiological damage of extended trauma occurs because we are forced to spend so much time in hyper-arousal – stuck in fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode.  
  
大多数长期创伤的生理损伤发生，是因为我们被迫在高度警觉的状态下花费大量时间——陷入战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好模式。

When we are chronically stressed out \[stuck in sympathetic nervous system activation\], detrimental somatic changes become ingrained in our bodies. Here are some of the most common examples of body-harming reactions to Cptsd stress:  
  
当我们长期处于压力状态\[陷入交感神经系统的激活\]时，有害的躯体变化就会在我们的身体中根深蒂固。以下是 Cptsd 压力对身体造成伤害的一些最常见反应：

Hypervigilance  
  
过度警觉

Shallow and Incomplete Breathing  
  
浅表且不完整的呼吸

Constant Adrenalization  
  
持续的肾上腺素分泌

Armoring, i.e., Chronic muscle tightness  
  
装甲，即慢性肌肉紧张

Wear and tear from rushing and armoring  
  
快速和装甲造成的磨损

Inability to be fully present, relaxed and grounded in our bodies  
  
无法完全存在于我们的身体中，放松并扎根

Sleep problems from being over-activated

[[null|]]Digestive disorders from a tightened digestive tract  
  
消化道的紧张引起的消化系统疾病

Physiological damage from excessive self-medication with alcohol, food or drugs  
  
过度使用酒精、食物或药物自我治疗导致的生理损伤

Moreover, in cases of physical and sexual abuse, our capacities to be physically comforted by touch are eliminated or compromised; and, in cases of verbal and emotional abuse, our capacities to be comforted by eye- and voice-contact are undeveloped or seriously diminished.  
  
此外，在身体和性虐待的情况下，我们通过触摸获得身体安慰的能力被消除或受损；而在言语和情感虐待的情况下，我们通过眼神和声音接触获得安慰的能力未得到发展或严重减弱。
