**Working With Food Issues  
  
与食物问题作斗争**

Let us explore one last arena of physical healing, and that is dietary self-help. I agree with John Bradshaw who says that almost everyone who grows up in a dysfunctional family has an eating disorder. This is a key factor in the digestive track problems that are a common symptom of Cptsd.  
  
让我们探索最后一个身体康复的领域，那就是饮食自助。我同意约翰·布拉德肖的说法，几乎每个在功能失调的家庭中长大的人都有饮食障碍。这是 Cptsd 常见症状消化系统问题的一个关键因素。

Changing your eating habits is extremely difficult. A client left this quote on my waiting room bulletin board: “Alcohol and other drug recovery is like dealing with a tiger in a cage. Recovery from eating disorders is like taking that tiger out of the cage three times a day and then taking it for a walk.”  
  
改变饮食习惯极其困难。一位客户在我的候诊室公告板上留下了这句话：“酒精和其他药物康复就像与笼中的老虎打交道。饮食障碍的康复就像每天三次把那只老虎从笼子里放出来，然后带它散步。”

Deconstructing food addictions, then, is daunting work that needs to be approached gradually and with a sense of compassion. This is because children who are traumatically abandoned naturally turn to food for comfort. Food offers us our first outside source of self-soothing, and when a child is starving for love, he frequently makes food his love object. Over the years he commonly “elevates” it to the status of a drug. Moreover, increasing scientific evidence is showing that processed food products combining high levels of sugar, salt and fat are especially addictive.  
  
解构食物成瘾是一项艰巨的工作，需要逐步进行，并带着同情心去对待。这是因为那些被创伤性地遗弃的孩子自然会转向食物寻求安慰。食物为我们提供了第一次外部自我安抚的来源，当一个孩子渴望爱时，他经常会将食物视为爱的对象。多年来，他通常将其“提升”到药物的地位。此外，越来越多的科学证据表明，结合高糖、高盐和高脂肪的加工食品尤其具有成瘾性。

Food addictions begin pre-verbally. They are functional and useful at the time and help us to survive the unbearable feelings of [[null|]]the abandonment mélange. Unfortunately, we are typically forced to rely on food-soothing for so long that this over-dependence is extremely difficult to overcome, and I do not recommend that anyone in early recovery make this their primary focus unless they have a life-threatening food issue. Instead, I prefer to recommend Mate’s harm reduction approach. Additionally, Geneen Roth’s book, _Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating_, also offers a moderate and sensible approach to dietary improvement.  
  
食物成瘾始于学语前。在当时，它们具有功能性和实用性，帮助我们承受被遗弃的复杂感受。不幸的是，我们通常被迫长期依赖食物来舒缓情绪，这种过度依赖极其难以克服，我不建议处于早期康复阶段的人将此作为他们的主要关注点，除非他们面临危及生命的食物问题。相反，我更倾向于推荐 Mate 的减害方法。此外，Geneen Roth 的书籍《摆脱强迫性进食》也提供了一种适度且合理的饮食改善方法。

While many survivors can be unconscious of their damaging eating habits, I have met various survivors who take it to the opposite extreme. I was once in the ranks of those who obsessively over-focus on dietary self-help hoping and expecting that all their suffering will be resolved if they can just find the perfect diet. Many also chase after every new highly touted supplement in this pursuit. Some of us also approach exercise in this manner.  
  
虽然许多幸存者可能对自己的有害饮食习惯浑然不觉，但我遇到过各种极端的幸存者。我曾经是那些痴迷于饮食自助的人之一，希望并期待只要找到完美的饮食，他们所有的痛苦就会得到解决。许多人也在这种追求中追逐每一个备受推崇的新补充剂。我们中的一些人也以这种方式对待运动。

These are understandable but simplistic versions of the salvation fantasy, and are typically pursued at the exclusion of working on more core issues of recovering. Nonetheless, almost everyone has some ideas about how they can eat \[and exercise\] more healthily. My recommendation is to try dietary adjustments when you can on a moderate, doable level.  
  
这些是可理解但过于简单的救赎幻想版本，通常在排除解决更核心的恢复问题的情况下追求。尽管如此，几乎每个人都有些关于如何更健康地饮食\[和锻炼\]的想法。我的建议是，在可能的情况下，在适度、可行的水平上尝试调整饮食。
