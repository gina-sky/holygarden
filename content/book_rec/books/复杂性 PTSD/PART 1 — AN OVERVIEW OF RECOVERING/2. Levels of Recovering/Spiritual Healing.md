**Soothing Abandonment Losses Via A Higher Sense Of Belonging  
  
通过更高的归属感来舒缓放弃的痛苦**

Spiritual beliefs are of course a subject of personal and sometimes private concern, and I believe and hope what I write here is not proselytizing. My aim, instead, is to point out psychological concepts that have a non-sectarian spiritual aspect. I am aware, however, that some survivors have suffered terrible spiritual abuse in childhood, and if the term “spiritual” is offensive or triggering in any way, please feel free to bypass this section. There are many other useful tools in this toolbox.  
  
精神信仰当然是个人和有时是私人的关注对象，我相信并希望我写下的内容不是在传教。我的目标，相反，是指出具有非宗派精神方面的心理学概念。然而，我意识到，一些幸存者在童年时期遭受了可怕的精神虐待，如果“精神”这个词在任何方面都让你感到冒犯或触发，请随意跳过这一部分。这个工具箱中还有许多其他有用的工具。

A key aspect of the abandonment depression in Cptsd is the lack of a sense of belonging to humanity, life, anyone or anything. I have met many survivors whose first glimmer of “belonging” came to them on a quest that began as a spiritual pursuit. Finding nothing but betrayal in the realm of humans, they turned to the spiritual for help.  
  
创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）中放弃抑郁的一个关键方面是缺乏对人类、生活、任何人或任何事物的归属感。我遇到过许多幸存者，他们第一次感受到“归属”是在一场起初作为精神追求的探险中。在人类领域他们只找到了背叛，于是转向精神寻求帮助。

Spiritual pursuits are sometimes fueled by an unconscious hope of finding a sense of belonging. The worst thing that can happen to a child is to be unwelcomed in his family of origin - to never feel included. Moreover, many survivors have little or no experience of any social arena that feels safe and welcoming.  
  
精神追求有时是由一种无意识的希望驱动的，希望找到一种归属感。对孩子来说最糟糕的事情就是在他原生家庭中不受欢迎——永远感觉不到被包括在内。此外，许多幸存者几乎没有或完全没有经历过任何感觉安全和受欢迎的社会场所。

Many survivors also do not find a sense of belonging in traditional or organized religions. Finding conventional religion too reminiscent of their dysfunctional families, some survivors look to more solitary spiritual approaches. They find a sense of belonging to something larger and more comforting by reading spiritual books or engaging in meditative practices. This also allows them to bypass the danger of direct human contact.  
  
许多幸存者也没有在传统或组织宗教中找到归属感。觉得传统宗教太过令人联想到他们功能失调的家庭，一些幸存者转向更独立的精神途径。他们通过阅读精神书籍或进行冥想练习，找到了对更大、更令人安慰的事物的归属感。这也让他们避开了直接人际接触的危险。

[[null|]]Other survivors have spiritual experiences of belonging to something greater and worthwhile by being in nature, by listening to music or by appreciating the arts. I once marveled at a book, whose title now eludes me, that was a compendium of quotes from many renowned people who had numinous experiences through the direct perception of nature’s beauty.  
  
其他幸存者通过在大自然中，通过聆听音乐或欣赏艺术，体验到属于某种更伟大、更有价值的东西。我曾对一本现在想不起书名的书感到惊奇，这本书汇集了许多著名人士通过直接感知自然之美所经历的神秘体验。

A _numinous_ experience is a powerful moving feeling of well being accompanied by a sense that there is a positive, benign force behind the universe, as well as within yourself. This in turn sometimes brings enough grace with it, that you have a profound feeling that you are essentially worthwhile, that you belong in this life, and that life is a gift.  
  
神秘体验是一种强烈的、令人感动的幸福感，伴随着一种感觉，即宇宙背后以及你自身中存在着一种积极、善良的力量。这反过来有时会带来足够的恩典，让你有一种深刻的感受，觉得自己本质上是有价值的，属于这个生活，生活是一种礼物。

One of my website respondents sent me her personal account of therapeutic gratitude. Her name is Mary Quinn \[of Ireland\]. In answer to my request to reprint her writing, she replied: “Yes, and in honor of my little one and for all the times her voice went unheard, you may use my name.”  
  
我的网站回应者之一给我发来了她个人的治疗性感恩故事。她的名字叫玛丽·奎恩（爱尔兰人）。在回答我是否可以重新发表她的作品时，她回复说：“是的，为了纪念我的孩子，以及所有她声音被忽视的时刻，你可以使用我的名字。”

“I went to the beach a couple of days ago in the morning and sat watching the sun coming up. I had an incredible moment of the purest clarity. I was watching birds flying low over the water, the moon was still visible and the sun was rising. I realized I was looking at three planets and there was not another person in sight.  
  
我几天前早上去了海滩，坐着看太阳升起。我经历了一个无比清晰的瞬间。我看着鸟儿在水面低飞，月亮依然可见，太阳正在升起。我意识到我正在看着三个行星，周围没有其他人。

“It was a moment of breathtaking beauty and the tears slid down my face at how deep it is possible to feel. I have been numb for so long. I wrapped my arms around myself and felt the presence of the little one so strongly it was almost painful but in a healing way if that makes sense. I realized that all the life experiences I have had to date brought me to that exact moment and gave me the depth to appreciate it at that level. A sense of peace washed through me like a gentle wave and for a few moments I felt a connection to a feeling [[null|]]of everything being part of life. It was breathtakingly beautiful. I felt like I was experiencing this moment with all of my senses and I never knew it was possible to be so much in my body.  
  
那是一个令人叹为观止的美丽时刻，我感受到了深深的感动，泪水顺着我的脸颊滑落。我已麻木了这么久。我紧紧地抱住自己，强烈地感受到了那个小家伙的存在，这几乎让我感到痛苦，但如果是治愈性的，那就好了。我意识到，我迄今为止所经历的所有生命体验都让我达到了那个确切的时刻，并赋予了我欣赏它的深度。一种平静的感觉像轻柔的海浪一样涌过我的身体，有那么一会儿，我感到自己与一切生命的感觉相连。那美得令人窒息。我感觉自己正在用所有的感官体验这个时刻，我从未知道可以如此深入地体验自己的身体。

“The gratitude feeling is deep and profound when it occurs. It feels like a moment of connection to life itself on the deepest level and all life circumstances and what I deem as problems pale to insignificance in those moments and there is only love in its purest form. It truly feels like a blessing albeit fleeting but gives enough sustenance and hope to continue the journey.”  
  
感激之情在发生时是深沉而深刻的。它感觉像是与生命本身在最深层次上的连接，那一刻，所有的生活环境和我认为的问题都变得微不足道，只有最纯粹的爱存在。这确实感觉像是一种祝福，尽管转瞬即逝，但它提供了足够的力量和希望，继续旅程。

Whatever the source, spiritual or numinous occurrences sometimes provide the survivor with her first sense of belonging to something bigger and essentially good. Such experiences can lead a survivor to an author or speaker or fellow traveler with similar sensibilities, and sometimes a door opens for finding comfort with a fellow human. Eventually, this may even grow into a sense that there are some humans out there who are good and safe enough to engage with.  
  
无论来源是什么，灵性或神圣的事件有时会给幸存者带来第一次感受到自己属于某个更大且本质上善良的东西的感觉。这样的经历可能会引导幸存者找到与有相似感受的作者、演讲者或同行者，有时甚至为与一个同类找到安慰打开了一扇门。最终，这甚至可能发展成一种感觉，即世界上有一些人足够善良和安全，可以与之交往。
