**Somatic Self-Help  
  
身体自助**

The good news is that some somatic repair happens automatically when we reduce our physiological stress by more efficient flashback management. Particularly potent help also comes from the grieving work of reclaiming the ability to cry self-compassionately and to express anger self-protectively. Both processes can release armoring, promote embodiment, improve sleep, decrease hyperarousal and encourage deeper and more rhythmic breathing.  
  
好消息是，当我们通过更有效的闪回管理减少生理压力时，一些躯体修复会自动发生。特别有力的帮助也来自于悲伤工作，重新获得自我同情地哭泣和自我保护地表达愤怒的能力。这两个过程都可以释放盔甲，促进具身化，改善睡眠，减少过度警觉，并鼓励更深更规律的呼吸。

Without further expressly somatic work, however, a full relaxed inhabitancy of your body may not be achieved. Fortunately, there are other modes of self-help for healing the physiological wounds of Cptsd. The “Somatic Mindfulness” and “Introspective Somatic Work” sections of [[12. The Map_ Managing the Abandonment Depression|chapter 12]] describe techniques that can help you to decrease adrenalization, to relax more deeply and to improve your digestion. Moreover, Step 7 of the flashback management steps at the beginning of [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]] contains six somatic, self-help techniques for relaxing out of the physiological hyperarousal of a flashback.  
  
然而，如果没有进一步明确地进行身体工作，可能无法完全放松地占据你的身体。幸运的是，还有其他自我帮助的方式可以治愈 Cptsd 的生理创伤。第 12 章的“身体意识”和“内省身体工作”部分描述了可以帮助你减少肾上腺素分泌、更深入地放松和改善消化功能的技巧。此外，第 8 章开头的闪回管理步骤的第 7 步包含了六种身体自我帮助技巧，用于放松闪回的生理过度激活状态。

[[null|]]Another especially helpful somatic practice is stretching. Regular systematic stretching of the body’s major muscle groups can help you to reduce the armoring that occurs when your 4F response is chronically triggered. This results from the fact that 4F activation tightens and contracts your body in anticipation of the need to fight back, flee, get small to escape notice, or rev up to launch into people-pleasing activity.  
  
另一种特别有用的身体练习是拉伸。定期系统地拉伸身体的主要肌肉群可以帮助你减少当你的 4F 反应长期被触发时产生的硬化。这源于 4F 激活会在你准备反击、逃跑、缩小以逃避注意或加速投入取悦他人的活动时，使你的身体紧绷和收缩。

Learning to stretch was a major ordeal for me because of my extreme body armoring. As noted above, it was a task of self-nurturing that I resented intensely, and it took me a long time to adopt stretching as a regular practice.  
  
由于我极端的身体硬化，学习拉伸对我来说是一项重大的挑战。如上所述，这是一项我强烈反感的自我滋养任务，我花了很长时间才将拉伸作为一种常规练习。

The fact that I had to weather many toxic shame attacks because I was always the least flexible person in the group did not help matters. Moreover, when various people commented about how good it felt to stretch, I felt both puzzled and further shamed, because it was anything but pleasant for me.  
  
我不得不承受许多有毒的羞辱攻击，因为我总是小组中最不灵活的人，这并没有帮助事情变得更好。此外，当各种人评论说拉伸感觉有多好时，我既感到困惑又感到进一步的羞辱，因为对我来说这根本不是一件愉快的事情。

Thankfully however, reading the literature about it convinced me about its great importance, and persistent practice eventually gave me results that I could not discount. I was rewarded by the resolution of decades old back problems. And although I still rarely enjoy the practice, I am absolutely convinced that it explains why I am still able to run, swim and play basketball in my mid sixties. Stretching has become for me a true labor of love and self-nurturance.  
  
然而，感谢阅读有关它的文献，这让我相信了它的极大重要性，而持续的练习最终给了我无法否认的结果。我因解决了几十年的背部问题而得到了回报。尽管我仍然很少享受练习，但我坚信这解释了为什么我六十多岁时还能跑步、游泳和打篮球。对我而言，拉伸已经成为了一种真爱和自我滋养的劳动。

Yoga, massage, meditation and relaxation training are formalized disciplines to aid in letting go of unnecessary body tension. Reasonably priced classes in these modalities are usually available in most communities.  
  
瑜伽、按摩、冥想和放松训练是正式化的学科，有助于释放不必要的身体紧张。这些方式通常在大多数社区都有合理价格的课程。

[[null|]]Finally, freeze types and freeze subtypes also typically benefit from various types of movement therapy and aerobic exercise regimes. Moreover, assertiveness training and anger release work are especially helpful for survivors who have difficulty accessing their assertiveness or instincts of self-protection.  
  
最后，冻结类型和冻结亚型通常也受益于各种类型的运动疗法和有氧运动计划。此外，自信训练和愤怒释放工作对于难以获得自信或自我保护本能的幸存者特别有帮助。
