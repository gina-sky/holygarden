**Shrinking The Critic  
  
缩小批评者**

Early abuse and abandonment forces the child to merge his identity with the superego, the part of the child’s brain that learns the rules of his caretakers in order to get and maintain acceptance. However, because acceptance is impossible in the Cptsd-engendering family, the superego gets stuck working overtime to achieve the impossible. Perseverating on finding a formula to win over her parents, the child eventually embraces perfectionism as a strategy to make her parents less dangerous and more engaging. Her one hope is that if she becomes smart, helpful, pretty, and flawless enough, her parents will finally care for her.  
  
早期的虐待和遗弃迫使孩子将自己的身份与超我合并，这是孩子大脑中学习照顾者规则的部分，以便获得和维持接受。然而，由于在创伤后应激障碍产生的家庭中接受是不可能的，超我陷入了过度工作的困境，试图实现不可能的事情。孩子坚持不懈地寻找赢得父母的方法，最终将完美主义作为一种策略，使父母不那么危险，更加吸引人。她唯一的希望是，如果她变得聪明、有用、漂亮、完美无瑕，父母最终会关心她。

[[null|]]Sadly, continued failure at winning their regard forces her to conclude that she is fatally flawed. She is loveless not because of her mistakes, but because she is a mistake. She can only see what is wrong with or missing in her.  
  
遗憾的是，持续无法赢得他们的好感让她得出结论，她有着致命的缺陷。她之所以没有爱，不是因为她的错误，而是因为她本身就是个错误。她只能看到自己身上的错误和缺失。

Anything she does, says, thinks, imagines or feels has the potential to spiral her down into a depressed abyss of fear and toxic shame. Her superego fledges into a full-blown, trauma-inducing critic.  
  
她所做的、所说的、所想的、所想象的或所感受的，都有可能让她陷入恐惧和有毒羞耻的抑郁深渊。她的超我变成了一个全面爆发、引发创伤的批评者。

Self-criticism, then, runs non-stop in a desperate attempt to avoid rejection-inducing mistakes. Drasticizing becomes obsessive to help the child foresee and avoid punishment and worsening abandonment. At the same time, it continuously fills her psyche with stories and images of catastrophe.  
  
因此，自我批评不断进行，这是一种绝望的尝试，以避免引起拒绝的错误。夸张变得痴迷，以帮助这个孩子预见并避免惩罚和加剧的遗弃。同时，它不断地在她的心理中填充着灾难的故事和图像。

The survivor becomes imprisoned by a jailer who will accept nothing but perfection. He is chauffeured by a hysterical driver who sees nothing but danger in every turn of the road. [[9. Shrinking the Inner Critic|Chapters 9]] and [^10] focus extensively on practical tools for shrinking your critic.  
  
幸存者被一个只接受完美的狱卒囚禁。他被一个歇斯底里的司机驾驶，司机在每一个道路转弯处都只看到危险。第 9 章和第 10 章详细介绍了缩小批评者的实用工具。
