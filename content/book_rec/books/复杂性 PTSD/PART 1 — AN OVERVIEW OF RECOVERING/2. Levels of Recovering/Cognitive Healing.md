\*\*COGNITIVE HEALING

认知疗愈\*\*

The first level of recovery usually involves repairing the damage that Cptsd wreaks on our thoughts and beliefs about ourselves.

恢复的第一步通常涉及修复创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）对我们关于自己的思想和信念造成的损害。

==Cognitive recovery work aims to make your brain user friendly. It focuses on recognizing and eliminating the destructive thoughts and thinking processes you were indoctrinated with in childhood. ==

认知恢复工作旨在使你的大脑变得易于使用。它专注于识别和消除你在童年时期被灌输的具有破坏性的思想和思维过程。

[[null|]]==Cognitive healing also depends on learning to choose healthy and more accurate ways of talking to and thinking about yourself. On the broadest level, this involves upgrading the story you tell yourself about your pain.==

认知疗愈还取决于学会选择健康且更准确的方式与自己对话和思考。在最高层次上，这涉及到提升你对自己痛苦的自我讲述。

We need to understand exactly how appalling parenting created the now self-perpetuating trauma that we live in. We can learn to do this in a way that takes the mountain of unfair self-blame off ourselves. We can redirect this blame to our parents’ dreadful child-rearing practices. And we can also do this in a way that motivates us to reject their influence so that we can freely orchestrate our journey of recovering.

我们需要确切地理解可怕的教养方式是如何创造出我们现在自我延续的创伤。我们可以以这种方式学习，这种方式能让我们摆脱那座不公平的自我责备的大山。我们可以将这种责备转向我们父母糟糕的育儿方式。而且我们还可以这样做，以激发我们拒绝他们的影响，从而我们可以自由地编排我们恢复的旅程。

==This work then requires us to build a fierce allegiance to ourselves. Such loyalty strengthens us for the cognitive work of freeing our brains from being conditioned to attack so many normal parts of our selves.==

这项工作需要我们对自己建立强烈的忠诚。这种忠诚能让我们在认知工作中变得更强大，帮助我们摆脱被条件化为攻击我们自身许多正常部分的倾向。

Cognitive work is fundamental to helping you disidentify from the self-hating critic with which your parents inculcated you. As I am writing this, my son’s friend synchronistically tells him: “This Lego creature I made spreads brain attack and eats away at the person.” I marvel at this synchronicity and think: “What a fitting image for the trauma-inducing parent”.

认知工作对于帮助你摆脱父母灌输给你的那个自我仇恨的批评者至关重要。在我写这段文字的时候，我儿子的朋友同步地告诉他：“我做的这个乐高生物会传播大脑攻击，并吞噬人。”我对这种同步性感到惊奇，并想：“这对创伤性父母来说是多么合适的形象。”
