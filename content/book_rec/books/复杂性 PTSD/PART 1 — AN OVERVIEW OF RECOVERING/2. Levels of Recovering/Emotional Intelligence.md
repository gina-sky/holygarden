**EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE  
  
情绪智力**

Daniel Goleman defines emotional intelligence as our ability to successfully recognize and manage our own feelings and to healthily [[null|]]respond to the feelings of others. As implied above, I believe the quality of our emotional intelligence is reflected in the degree to which we accept all of our feelings without automatically dissociating from them or expressing them in a way that hurts ourselves or others. When we are emotionally intelligent we also extend this acceptance to our intimates. One of my clients calls this the hallmark of “relationships.”  
  
丹尼尔·戈尔曼将情绪智力定义为我们成功地识别和管理自己的能力，以及健康地回应他人情感的能力。如上所述，我认为我们情绪智力的质量体现在我们接受所有情感的程度，而不会自动与之分离，也不会以伤害自己或他人的方式表达它们。当我们具有情绪智力时，我们也会将这种接受扩展到我们的亲密关系中。我的一个客户称这是“关系”的标志。

Another way of saying this is that I have self-esteem to the degree that I keep my heart open to myself in all my emotional states. And, I have intimacy when my friend and I offer this type of emotional acceptance to each other. Once again, this does not condone destructive expressions of anger which are, of course, counterproductive to trust and intimacy.  
  
另一种说法是，我在所有情绪状态下都保持内心的开放，因此我有自尊。而且，当我和朋友互相提供这种情感接受时，我拥有亲密感。再次强调，这并不纵容破坏性的愤怒表达，这种表达当然是有害于信任和亲密感的。

Cptsd-engendering parents often hypocritically attack their children’s emotional expression in a bi-modal way. This occurs when the child is both abused for emoting and is, at the same time, abused by her caretaker’s toxic emotional expression.  
  
创伤后应激障碍的父母常常以双模态的方式虚伪地攻击孩子的情感表达。这种情况发生在孩子因为表达情感而受到虐待，同时又被照顾者的有毒情感表达所虐待。

Most traumatizing parents are especially contemptuous towards the child’s expression of emotional pain. This contempt then forces the child’s all-important capacity for healthy grieving into developmental arrest.  
  
大多数造成创伤的父母特别蔑视孩子表达情感痛苦的行为。这种蔑视迫使孩子重要的健康哀悼能力陷入发育停滞。

One archetypal example of this is seen in the parent who hurts his child to the point of tears, and then has the nerve to say: “Stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about!” A client once told me that he often fantasized about giving his father this angry reply: “What are you talking about, you already gave me something to cry about?!” He did not, however, because he had long since learned that getting angry back was a capital crime that would elicit the most savage retaliation. Typically it would be delivered with homicidal rage: “I’ll knock you from here to Kingdom come!”  
  
一个典型的例子是父母伤害孩子到流泪的程度，然后厚颜无耻地说：“别哭了，否则我给你点哭的！”一位客户曾经告诉我，他经常幻想给他的父亲一个愤怒的回答：“你在说什么，你已经给我点哭的了？！”然而，他没有这样做，因为他早已学会，反击愤怒是一种严重的罪行，会招致最野蛮的报复。通常这种报复会伴随着杀人的愤怒：“我要把你从这儿赶到天堂去！”

[[null|]]The above is of course a blatant example of the slaughtering of emotional expression. Just as common is the insidious, passive-aggressive assault on emoting which is seen in the parent who shuns her child for expressing his feelings. This is seen in the emotionally abandoning parent who sequesters the child in a timeout for crying, or routinely retreats from the crying child into her room.  
  
上述当然是情感表达被践踏的明显例子。同样常见的是，父母对孩子的情感表达采取隐秘的、消极攻击性的攻击，这在父母避开孩子表达情感时可以看到。这体现在情感上遗弃孩子的父母，将孩子隔离在 timeouts 中哭泣，或者经常从哭泣的孩子身边退回到自己的房间。

The worst, most damaging example of this occurs when this is done to the pre-verbal toddler \[or baby!\] who only has emotions with which to express herself. Pre-verbal children are by definition far too young to learn the 2-3 year-olds’ developmental task of using her words to communicate about her feelings.  
  
最糟糕、最具破坏性的例子发生在对尚未学会说话的幼儿（或婴儿！）进行这种行为时，他们只能用情绪来表达自己。根据定义，学龄前儿童远远太小，无法学习 2-3 岁儿童的发育任务，即用她的语言来传达她的感受。

An especially nasty form of emotional abuse occurs in the traumatizing family when the child is even attacked for displays of pleasant emotion. As I write this I flashback to scenes of my mother sneering at my little sister and snarling: “What are you so happy about!”, and my father’s frequent: “What are you laughing at – wipe that smile off your face!”  
  
在创伤性的家庭中，当孩子甚至因为表现出愉快的情绪而受到攻击时，就会发生一种特别恶劣的情感虐待。当我写这段话时，我回想起我母亲对妹妹冷笑和咆哮：“你这么高兴是什么意思！”以及我父亲经常说的：“你在笑什么——把你的笑容擦掉！”

Emotional abuse is also almost always also accompanied by emotional abandonment, which can most simply be described as a relentless lack of parental warmth and love. Sometimes this is most poignantly described as not being liked by your parents, which belies the many Cptsd-inducing parents who say they love their children, but demonstrate in a thousand ways that they do not like them. “The sight of you makes me sick” was very popular with such parents when I was growing up.  
  
情感虐待几乎总是伴随着情感遗弃，这可以最简单地描述为无情的缺乏父母的温暖和爱。有时这最尖锐地描述为不被父母喜欢，这掩盖了许多声称爱他们的孩子，但在一千种方式中表现出他们并不喜欢他们。在我成长过程中，“看到你就让我恶心”是这类父母中流行的一句话。

It can still bring tears to my eyes to remember my emotionally abandoned young sister secreted in a corner of the house begging our family dog: “Like me, Ginger, Like me!”  
  
它仍然能让我眼中含泪，想起那个被情感遗弃的年轻妹妹，她躲在房子的一个角落里，乞求我们的家庭狗：“像我，吉姆，像我！”
