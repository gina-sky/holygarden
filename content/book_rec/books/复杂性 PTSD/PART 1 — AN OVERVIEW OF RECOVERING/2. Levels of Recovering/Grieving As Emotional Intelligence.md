**Grieving As Emotional Intelligence  
  
哀悼作为情商**

Grieving is the key process for reconnecting with our repressed emotional intelligence. Grieving reconnects us with our full complement of feelings. Grieving is necessary to help us release and work through our pain about the terrible losses of our childhoods. These losses are like deaths of parts of our selves, and grieving can often initiate their rebirth.  
  
哀悼是我们重新连接被压抑的情感智力的关键过程。哀悼让我们重新与我们的全部情感相连。哀悼对于帮助我们释放和处理我们童年可怕损失的痛苦是必要的。这些损失就像是我们自我的部分死亡，而哀悼常常能引发它们的重生。
