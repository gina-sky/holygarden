**Therapeutic Flashbacks And Growing Pains  
  
治疗性闪回与成长之痛**

Healing from childhood trauma is also a long gradual process because recovering your full self-expression requires a great deal of practice. Being yourself can be intimidating and flashback-inducing. Healthy self-assertion was punished like a capital crime in many dysfunctional families. Expressing yourself in ways that your parents forbade typically triggers intense flashbacks at first. This can cause you to lose sight of how this practice gradually reduces the chronic pain of remaining invisible.  
  
从童年创伤中恢复也是一个漫长而渐进的过程，因为恢复你全部的自我表达需要大量的练习。做你自己可能会让人感到害怕并引发闪回。在许多功能失调的家庭中，健康的自我主张就像一项重罪一样受到惩罚。以父母禁止的方式表达自己最初通常会引发强烈的闪回。这可能会让你失去如何通过这种练习逐渐减轻隐形慢性痛苦的认识。

We can encourage ourselves to face these growing pains by conceptualizing them as therapeutic flashbacks. We then choose to weather these flashbacks to stop the past from holding us back, to reclaim the fundamental human rights that our parents denied us, and to finally own what is rightfully ours for the taking.  
  
我们可以通过将这些成长之痛概念化为治疗性闪回来鼓励自己面对它们。然后我们选择经受这些闪回，阻止过去阻碍我们，重新夺回父母剥夺我们的基本人权，并最终拥有我们应得的东西。

We can further bolster ourselves for such necessary flashbacks by comparing “speaking up” to going to the dentist for a toothache. Unless we accept the acute pain of the dentist’s therapeutic [[null|]]procedure, we will suffer chronic dental discomfit indefinitely. Unless we speak up, the loneliness of our silence will imprison us forever.  
  
我们可以通过将“发声”比作去看牙医治疗牙痛来进一步强化我们对这种必要回溯的准备。除非我们接受牙医治疗过程中的剧痛，否则我们将无限期地忍受慢性牙痛。除非我们发声，否则我们沉默的孤独将永远囚禁我们。

Recovering from overwhelmingly painful childhoods is also so difficult because we understandably want to avoid any further pain at all. We may even believe that we need to risk a flashback and practice speaking up. But at the moment of facing the triggering that silence can so easily avoid, we cannot sometimes help giving up and remaining mute.  
  
从极度痛苦的童年中恢复过来也非常困难，因为我们理解地想要避免任何进一步的痛苦。我们甚至可能认为我们需要冒险回忆并练习发声。但在面对可以轻易避免的沉默触发点时，我们有时无法不放弃并保持沉默。

However, if we are ever to recover our real voice, we must sometimes invoke the energy of bravery. Bravery is, in my opinion, defined by fear. It is taking right action despite being afraid. It is not brave to do things that are not scary.  
  
然而，如果我们想要恢复我们的真实声音，有时我们必须唤起勇敢的能量。在我看来，勇敢是由恐惧定义的。它是在害怕的情况下采取正确的行动。做不令人害怕的事情并不勇敢。

The anger work described in [[11. Grieving|chapter 11]] can help you with this enormously. With a strong enough intention you can begin by occasionally invoking the kind of courage that involves _feeling the fear and doing it anyway_. You can nudge yourself to do it to rescue your inner child from the loneliness of never being seen or heard.  
  
第 11 章中描述的愤怒工作可以极大地帮助你。只要有足够的决心，你可以从偶尔唤起那种涉及感受到恐惧却依然行动的勇气开始。你可以自我激励去做，以拯救你的内在小孩，使其不再孤独地从未被看到或听到。

Moreover, when we embrace this practice we will eventually learn that fear does not have to disabling. We can be afraid and still act powerfully. We can refuse to tolerate never speaking up, never having our say, never stating a preference, and never saying “no” to set a boundary.  
  
此外，当我们接受这种做法时，我们最终会学到恐惧并不一定具有致残性。我们可以感到害怕，同时仍然能够有力地行动。我们可以拒绝容忍从不发声，从不表达自己的意见，从不表达自己的偏好，以及从不说不来设定界限。

With enough practice, therapeutic flashbacks not only diminish, but begin to be replaced by a healthy sense of pride in ourselves for our courageous self-championing. More and more we are rewarded with feelings of safe belonging in the world.  
  
随着练习的深入，治疗性闪回不仅会减少，而且开始被我们对自身勇敢捍卫的骄傲所取代。我们越来越感受到在世界中安全归属的喜悦。

It is crucial for deeper level recovery that we learn that feelings of fear, shame and guilt are sometimes signs that we have said or done the right thing. They are emotional flashbacks to how we were traumatized for trying to claim normal human privileges.  
  
对于更深层次的恢复来说，我们认识到恐惧、羞耻和内疚感有时是我们说对了或做对了事情的标志至关重要。它们是我们试图主张正常人类特权而受到创伤时的情绪闪回。

[[null|]]As our recovery progresses, we need to learn to endure these feelings. Reinterpreting the deeper meaning of these feelings is key to accomplishing this. Typically this involves epiphanies like the following. “I feel afraid now, but I am not in danger like I was as a child.” “I feel guilty not because I am guilty, but because I was intimidated into feeling guilty for expressing my opinions, my needs and my preferences.” “I feel shame because my parents rained disgust on me for being me. I say no to these toxic parental curses, and I am proud and right to see how they tried to murder my soul. I give them their shame back as disgust – the disgust any healthy adult feels when he sees a parent bullying a child with contempt, or when he sees a parent heartlessly ignoring a suffering child.”  
  
随着我们的恢复进展，我们需要学会忍受这些感受。重新解读这些感受的深层含义是完成这一目标的关键。通常这涉及到以下这样的顿悟：“我现在感到害怕，但不像小时候那样处于危险之中。”“我感到内疚，并不是因为我真的有罪，而是因为我被恐吓去感到内疚，因为我表达了自己的观点、需求和偏好。”“我感到羞耻，因为我的父母因为我而感到厌恶。我拒绝这些有毒的父母的诅咒，我为他们试图摧毁我的灵魂而感到骄傲和正确。我把他们的羞耻还给他们，就像任何健康的成年人看到父母用轻蔑的态度欺负孩子，或者看到父母无情地忽视受苦的孩子时所感到的厌恶一样。”
