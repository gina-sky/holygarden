**Cultivating Patience With The Gradual Progression Of Recovery  
  
培养对康复逐渐进展的耐心**

As stated earlier, recovery from Cptsd is complex. Sometimes, it can feel so hopelessly complex that we totally give up and get stuck in inertia for considerable lengths of time. This is why it is so important to understand that recovery is gradual and frequently a backwards and forwards process.  
  
如前所述，从创伤后应激障碍中恢复是复杂的。有时，它可能感觉如此绝望地复杂，以至于我们完全放弃，并陷入长时间的惰性。这就是为什么理解恢复是渐进的，并且经常是来回的过程如此重要。

Effective recovery is often limited to only progressing in one or two areas at a time. Biting off more than we can chew and trying to accomplish too much too soon is often counterproductive. As a flight type, I spent years in mid-range recovery workaholically spinning my wheels trying to fix and change everything at once. I describe this at greater length in the “When Recovery becomes Obsessive-Compulsive” section of my first book \[p140-141\].  
  
有效的恢复通常一次只限于在某一两个领域取得进展。试图一口吃掉太多，或者试图过早地完成太多，往往适得其反。作为一名飞行类型，我多年来在中度恢复工作中沉迷于无休止地旋转车轮，试图一次性修复和改变一切。我在我的第一本书的“当恢复变得强迫性”部分更详细地描述了这一点\[第 140-141 页\]。

We often need to simplify our self-help efforts in early recovery. Accordingly, I recommend making shrinking the critic \[[9. Shrinking the Inner Critic|chapter 9]]\] your “go to” response if you feel unsure of how to proceed.  
  
在早期恢复中，我们通常需要简化我们的自助努力。因此，如果你不确定如何继续前进，我建议将缩小批评者\[第 9 章\]作为你的“常规”反应。

Once the critic is reduced enough that you can notice increasing periods of your brain being user-friendly, impulses to help and care for yourself naturally begin to arise. As this happens it becomes easier to tell whether you are guiding yourself with love or a whip. When you realize it’s the whip, please try to disarm your critic and treat yourself with the kindness you would extend to any young child who is struggling and having a hard time.  
  
一旦批评减少到你能注意到大脑越来越友好，帮助和照顾自己的冲动自然会开始出现。当这种情况发生时，就更容易判断你是用爱还是用鞭子来引导自己。当你意识到那是鞭子时，请尽量安抚你的批评者，用你愿意给予任何努力和遇到困难的年幼孩子的善意来对待自己。

Nowhere is patience with ourselves more important than with the inner critic work. Typically the inner critic is too omnipresent to confront on every occasion. To do so would often leave no time for anything else.  
  
现在，耐心对待自己比对待内心的批评者更为重要。通常，内心的批评者无处不在，难以在每一个场合都面对。这样做通常会让人没有时间做其他任何事情。

[[null|]]But when we practice critic-shrinking in a gradually increasing way over time, we can more consistently disidentify from its negative focus and switch to a more self-supportive perspective. Eventually a new positive habit of rescuing ourselves from shame and self-hate takes on its own life. I still have my unfair share of flashbacks, but rarely do I ever side with my toxic critic.  
  
但当我们随着时间的推移逐渐增加批评缩小的练习时，我们可以更一致地与它的负面焦点脱钩，转而采取更自我支持的观点。最终，一种新的积极习惯——从羞耻和自我仇恨中拯救自己——开始拥有自己的生活。我仍然有我那份不公平的闪回，但很少会站在我那有毒的批评者一边。

Any self-help practices that we are trying to make second nature often work in this way. When we practice enough, self-help starts to become a matter of common sense. It reverberates as _right action_ and gradually takes on its own life as we attune to the true nature of our spirits and souls which are inherently self-supportive.  
  
任何我们试图使之成为第二本能的自我帮助实践通常都是这样运作的。当我们练习得足够多时，自我帮助开始变成常识。它作为正确的行动回响，并逐渐在我们调整到我们精神和灵魂的真正本质时，获得自己的生命，这些本质天生就是自我支持的。

We also aid our recovery greatly by challenging the all-or-none thinking of the critic whenever it judges us for not being perfect in our efforts. “Progress not perfection” is a powerful mantra for guiding our self-help recovery efforts.  
  
我们也通过挑战批评家对我们努力不够完美的评判时的全有或全无思维，极大地帮助了我们的恢复。“进步而非完美”是我们自我帮助恢复努力的有力咒语。

Moreover as recovering progresses, and especially as the critic shrinks, the desire to help yourself- to care for yourself - becomes more spontaneous. This is especially true when we mindfully do things for ourselves in a spirit of loving-kindness. As such, we can do it for the child we were – the child who was deprived through no fault of her own. And, we can do it because we believe every child, without exception, deserves loving care.  
  
此外，随着恢复的进展，尤其是随着批评家的缩小，自我帮助的愿望——关心自己的愿望——变得更加自然。当我们以慈爱之心为自己做事时，这一点尤其正确。这样，我们可以为那个我们曾经是的孩子——那个因自身无过错而受剥夺的孩子——做这件事。而且，我们可以这样做，因为我们相信每个孩子，无一例外，都值得得到爱的关怀。

Finally, if the reader is like I was in the past and has no overall perspective on his suffering, he may feel like he is spinning his wheels on one icy patch of road after another. I had decades of trying everything under the sun with what felt like a deepening sense of futility and defectiveness. Gratefully, I eventually reached an invisible critical mass, and realized I had actually come a long way. I had acquired quite a few pieces in this puzzle of recovery, and only needed to organize them into a map to move along further. As such, [[null|]]I have designed a ground plan that has helped me, my clients and website respondents to make sense of their suffering and to see how to effectively reduce it. I hope and pray that the cartography in this book will also offer you relief.  
  
最后，如果读者像我过去一样，对所受的苦难没有整体的认识，他可能会觉得自己就像在一条条冰封的道路上空转。我尝试了数十年的各种方法，感觉越来越无力和不完整。幸运的是，我终于达到了一个无形的临界点，意识到自己已经走了很长的路。我已经在这个康复的谜题中收集了许多碎片，只需要将它们组织成一张地图，才能继续前进。因此，我设计了一个基础计划，帮助我、我的客户和网站回复者理解他们的苦难，并了解如何有效地减轻它。我希望这本书中的地图学也能为你带来缓解。
