\*\*Accepting Recovery As A Lifelong Process

接受康复是一个终身的过程\*\*

It is exceedingly difficult to accept the proposition – the fact – that recovery is never complete. And although we can expect our flashbacks to markedly decrease over time, it is tremendously difficult, and sometimes impossible, to let go of the salvation fantasy that we will one day be forever free of them.

接受康复永远不可能完全实现这一观点——这一事实——极其困难。虽然我们可以期待随着时间的推移，我们的回忆会显著减少，但放下我们有一天将永远摆脱它们的救赎幻想，却非常困难，有时甚至不可能。

Yet when we do not loosen our grip on the salvation fantasy, we remain extremely susceptible to blaming ourselves every time we have a flashback. Understanding this is so crucial because recovery typically progresses in a process that has many temporary regressions. Moreover, most recoverees often have the unfortunate subjective experience that the temporary regression feels as permanent as concrete. This is especially true because of the _interminability_ feeling of flashbacks. When we flashback, we regress to our child-mind which was incapable of imagining a future any different than the everlasting present of being so abandoned.

然而，当我们不对救赎幻想放松控制时，每次闪回都会极度容易责怪自己。理解这一点至关重要，因为康复通常是一个包含许多暂时性倒退的过程。此外，大多数康复者往往会有不幸的主观体验，即这种暂时性倒退感觉就像混凝土一样永久。这尤其是因为闪回的无限延续感。当我们闪回时，我们会退回到无法想象不同于被遗弃的永恒当下的儿童心态。

[[null|]]So how can we come to bear the knowledge that our awful childhoods have created some permanent damage? It helps me to see my Cptsd as somewhat analogous to diabetes, i.e., a condition that will need management throughout my life. This is a piece of bad news that naturally feels offensively unpalatable, but the good news, as with diabetes, is that as we become more skilled at flashback management, Cptsd can gradually become infrequently bothersome. And even more importantly, we can evolve towards leading increasingly rich and rewarding lives.

所以，我们如何才能承受我们糟糕的童年造成的永久性伤害呢？我觉得将我的 Cptsd 看作是某种类似于糖尿病的疾病，即一种需要我终身管理的状况，这对我有所帮助。这是一个自然感觉令人不悦的坏消息，但好消息，就像糖尿病一样，随着我们越来越擅长处理闪回，Cptsd 可以逐渐变得不那么令人烦恼。更重要的是，我们可以朝着过上越来越丰富和有成就感的生活进化。

Even better news is that Cptsd, when efficiently managed, eventually bestows gifts. It comes with significant silver linings - unavailable to those less traumatized - as we will see at the end of the chapter.

甚至更好的消息是，当创伤后应激障碍得到有效管理时，最终会带来礼物。它伴随着重要的积极面——那些受创伤程度较轻的人无法享受到——正如我们在本章末尾将看到的。
