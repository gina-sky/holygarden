**The Emotional Imperialism Of “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”  
  
“别担心，快乐就好”的情感帝国主义**

One reason that recovering survivors attain greater emotional intelligence is that they eventually see through the mainstream media’s indoctrination that people should be happy all the time.  
  
康复中的幸存者获得更高情商的一个原因是，他们最终看穿了主流媒体灌输的“人们应该时刻快乐”的洗脑。

[[null|]]Much of the general populace, however, becomes increasingly dissociated from their full emotional experience by anxiously pushing to pump up their mood. Many “normal” people strive to fulfill the pursuit of happiness as if it were a patriotic duty. More and more they employ socially acceptable addictions to accomplish this. Snacking, spending, self-medicating, and online puttering are widespread addictions that seem to be ever on the rise.  
  
然而，许多人却因为焦虑地试图提升自己的情绪，而越来越脱离了完整的情感体验。许多“正常人”努力追求幸福，仿佛这是一项爱国义务。他们越来越多地使用社会可接受的成瘾行为来实现这一目标。零食、消费、自我医疗和在线闲逛是普遍的成瘾行为，似乎一直在上升。

A particularly rampant example of unhealthy mood-altering behavior is porn addiction. Addiction to pornography creates a terrible narrowing of consciousness in the many men who are afflicted with it. It commonly destroys their capacity for real intimacy. Tragically, the use of porn is more and more “normalized”, even in many psychological circles.  
  
不健康情绪调节行为的一个特别猖獗的例子是色情成瘾。对色情的成瘾在许多受其困扰的男性中造成了意识上的严重狭隘。它通常摧毁了他们真实亲密的能力。遗憾的是，使用色情的内容越来越“正常化”，甚至在许多心理学圈子中也是如此。

As we become more emotionally intelligent, we free ourselves from the hysteria-inducing pressure to continuously pump up the joy in our life.  
  
随着我们越来越具有情感智慧，我们摆脱了不断提升生活中快乐感的歇斯底里压力。

Please do not read this as an “Ode against Joy”. It is a blessing to have our natural fair share of laughter and feeling good. But I believe it also a blessing to resist the growing emotional imperialism that demands we become fountains of joy. We are assaulted daily with messages from advertisements, from laugh track-saturated TV shows, and from new age enlightenment gurus who shame us into believing that we are “less than”, if we are not constantly bubbling over with ecstatic Disneyland-like enthusiasm.  
  
请不要把这解读为“欢乐颂”。拥有我们自然的快乐和愉悦是一种祝福。但我相信，抵制日益增长的情感帝国主义，这种帝国主义要求我们成为欢乐的源泉，也是一种祝福。我们每天都被广告、充满笑声的电视节目和新时代启蒙大师的信息所攻击，他们羞辱我们，让我们相信，如果我们不是时刻充满迪士尼乐园般的狂喜，我们就是“不够好”。

The pressure to be always up was an enormous shame trigger for me for decades. Sadly, I increasingly see clients and friends struggling with self-contempt for not being happy enough.  
  
几十年来，总是要保持兴奋对我来说是一个巨大的羞耻触发器。遗憾的是，我越来越多地看到客户和朋友们因为不够快乐而挣扎，感到自我厌恶。

[[null|]]Once again, I am certainly not knocking joy, but when it is inauthentic, it is disconcertingly sad and sometimes alienating. In worst case scenarios, a controlling narcissist can emotionally blackmail us to join him in falsely emoting joy. Just as painful is when we codependents force ourselves to laugh to cover up our fear or shame.  
  
再次强调，我当然不是在批评快乐，但当它不真诚时，它令人不安地悲伤，有时甚至让人感到疏远。在最糟糕的情况下，一个控制欲强的自恋者可能会用情感勒索的方式，强迫我们和他一起假装快乐。同样痛苦的是，当我们这些共依存者强迫自己笑出声来，以掩盖我们的恐惧或羞耻。

This is also not to say that authentic joy cannot be contagious. Contagious joy is the wonderful experience of being positively triggered into vicariously sharing someone else’s authentic delight. \[For an experience of this, go to [www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) and search for “Quadruplets Laughing”\].  
  
这也不是说真正的快乐不能传染。传染的快乐是那种被积极触发，从而间接分享他人真正喜悦的奇妙体验。\[要体验这种感觉，请访问 www.youtube.com，搜索“四胞胎大笑”\]。

In my experience, it seems that authentic joy is much more common in the lives of well parented children. I also do not think that joy is typically as dominant an emotional theme in adult life unless it is synthetically induced with drugs or alcohol. On the other hand, experiences of joy for survivors can gradually become more frequent as a person’s recovery efforts promote increasing feelings of safety in the world.  
  
在我的经验中，似乎在得到良好教育的孩子的生活中，真实的快乐更为常见。我也不认为快乐通常在成年生活中是一个占主导地位的情感主题，除非它是通过药物或酒精人为诱导的。另一方面，对于幸存者来说，随着他们的康复努力促进了对世界的安全感日益增强，快乐的体验可以逐渐变得更加频繁。

As our emotional intelligence increases, I see considerable evidence that our expectations of joy become more reasonable. This allows us to let go of permanent happiness as the unrealistic goal of recovery. Until this happens, we remain at the mercy of the critic’s contemptuous diatribes that we are not being joyful enough. One of my clients recently became mindful enough to see how he was shaming himself for not being as jubilant as those in the beer commercials.  
  
随着我们情商的提高，我看到大量证据表明我们对快乐的期望变得更加合理。这使我们能够放弃将永久快乐作为不切实际的康复目标。直到这种情况发生，我们仍然受制于批评者的轻蔑抨击，说我们不够快乐。我的一个客户最近足够有意识，能够看到他是如何因为不如啤酒广告中的人那样欢快而羞辱自己。

As a concluding comment to this overview, it is important to emphasize that, like most things in life, there are degrees of Cptsd. The continuum of Cptsd ranges from mild neurosis to psychosis, and from highly functioning to non-functioning. Its severity ranges from having extended periods without flashbacks to being in full [[null|]]flashback horror much of the time. This range also varies from a condition of increased experiences of thriving to a condition of barely surviving disability.  
  
作为对本概述的总结，重要的是强调，就像生活中大多数事情一样，创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）也有程度之分。创伤后应激障碍的连续体从轻微神经症到精神分裂症，从高度功能到非功能状态不等。其严重程度从长时间没有闪回症状到大部分时间处于完全的闪回恐怖状态不等。这个范围也涵盖了从经历丰富、充满活力的状态到勉强生存、残疾的状态。

Progress in recovery is seen, then, in flashbacks becoming more manageable and life satisfaction becoming continuously more frequent. A friend of mine once joked with me: “I’ve got so much recovery, I’m beyond normal – I’m supernormal. I make the normies look like they’re the ones with Cptsd.”  
  
在恢复过程中，我们可以看到闪回变得更加可控，生活满意度也变得越来越频繁。我的一个朋友曾经和我开玩笑说：“我恢复得这么好，已经超越了正常——我是超常。我让那些普通人看起来像是患有 Cptsd 的人。”

As we end the overview, we are ready to move to the [[5. What if I Was Never Hit_|next chapter]], which explains how varying childhood trauma histories can cause Cptsd. Here we will also see how verbal and emotional abuse alone can cause Cptsd, and how profound emotional abandonment is typically at the core of most Cptsd.  
  
随着我们结束概述，我们准备进入下一章，本章将解释不同的童年创伤史如何导致创伤后应激障碍。在这里，我们还将看到仅言语和情感虐待本身如何导致创伤后应激障碍，以及深刻的情感遗弃通常是大多数创伤后应激障碍的核心。
