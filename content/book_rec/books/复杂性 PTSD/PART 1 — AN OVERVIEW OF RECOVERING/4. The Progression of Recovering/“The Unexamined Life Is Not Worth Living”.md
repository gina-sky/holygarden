\*\*“The Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living”

“未经审视的生活不值得过”\*\*

A further silver lining in recovery is the attainment of a much richer internal life. The introspective process, so fundamental to effective recovery work, eventually deepens and enriches survivors’ psyches. Ongoing mindful exploration of all aspects of our experience helps us see firsthand what Socrates meant when he said: “The unexamined life is not worth living”.

在恢复过程中，另一个积极的方面是获得更加丰富的内心生活。这种内省过程对于有效的恢复工作至关重要，最终会深化并丰富幸存者的心理。持续地有意识地探索我们经历的所有方面，帮助我们亲身体验到苏格拉底所说的：“未经审视的生活不值得过”。

The survivor who follows the introspective “road less travelled” becomes increasingly free of compulsive and unconscious allegiance to unhelpful familial, religious and societal values that were instilled at an impressionable age.

跟随内省的“少有人走的路”的幸存者，越来越摆脱了对无益的家庭、宗教和社会价值观的强迫性和无意识的忠诚，这些价值观是在一个易受影响的年龄被灌输的。

The recoveree now gets to choose her own values and reject those that are not in her own best interest. She develops a deeper more grounded self-respect that is not contingent upon going with the herd and shifting center with every new popular trend. In psychological parlance, she becomes free and brave enough to individuate and develop more of her full potential.

康复者现在可以自己选择价值观，拒绝那些不符合她自身最佳利益的价值观。她培养了一种更深沉、更稳固的自尊，这种自尊不依赖于随波逐流和随着每个新的流行趋势而改变中心。在心理学的术语中，她变得自由而勇敢，足以实现个性化，并发挥更多的潜力。

In Joseph Campbell’s words, the survivor learns to “follows his own bliss”. He is freer to pursue activities and interests that naturally appeal to him. He evolves into his own sense of style. He may even feel emboldened to coif and dress himself without adherence to the standards of fashion. He may extend this freedom into his home décor. In this vein, I have seen many survivors discover their own aesthetic, as well as an increased appreciation of beauty in general. How this contrasts with many of the homes of my “normal” sports-buddies, whose homes are often sparsely decorated, as if they are too afraid to put something out or up lest it not be cool enough.

在约瑟夫·坎贝尔的话中，幸存者学会“追随自己的快乐”。他可以更自由地追求自然吸引他的活动和兴趣。他发展出自己的风格感。他甚至可能感到有勇气不遵循时尚标准来打扮自己。他甚至可能将这种自由扩展到家居装饰中。在这方面，我看到许多幸存者发现了自己的审美观，以及对美的总体欣赏程度的提高。这与我的许多“正常”运动伙伴的家形成了鲜明对比，他们的家通常装饰得很简单，好像他们害怕拿出或挂上任何东西，以免不够酷。

As the survivor recovers the right of free choice, she becomes more open to trying new things – healthy things that mainstream society [[null|]]might consider uncool or even taboo. Here are some examples of this that I believe are conducive to both recovery and healthy everyday living: voluntary simplicity, improved diet, meditation, alternative medicine, broad scale compassion, environmentalism, deeper emotional communication and a broader use of the grieving process.

随着幸存者恢复自由选择的权利，她变得更加愿意尝试新事物——主流社会可能认为不酷甚至禁忌的健康事物。以下是我认为有利于康复和健康日常生活的几个例子：自愿简约、改善饮食、冥想、替代医学、广泛的同情心、环保、更深入的情感交流和更广泛地使用哀悼过程。

The survivor who pursues long-term development on his journey of recovering generally achieves greater overall evolution than the average citizen. For many untraumatized people, the pursuit of ongoing learning often stops after their last formal learning experience – whether that is high school or college.

追求长期发展的幸存者在康复之旅中通常比普通公民实现更大的整体进化。对于许多未受创伤的人来说，持续学习的追求往往在他们最后一次正式学习经历之后停止——无论那是高中还是大学。

Introspective development also rewards the recoveree with more perspective and wisdom in making important life choices. It also improves his everyday instinctual choices, such as whether to fight, flee, freeze or fawn in times of real danger.

内省式发展也使康复者获得更多视角和智慧，以便在做出重要生活选择时。它还提高了他在真正危险时刻的日常本能选择，例如是否战斗、逃跑、冻结或讨好。

Finally, another silver lining, often achieved in later stage recovery, is a greater ability to handle normal pain in the most healthy and least retraumatizing way. By normal pain, I mean the recurring existential pain all human beings experience from time to time via encounters with loss, illness, money troubles, time pressures, etc. Such painful encounters can produce emotional reactions like anger, sadness, fear and depression. The average person has not learned how to verbally ventilate and metabolize their feelings about such events. This results in them getting stuck in painful emotional places, especially depression, for inordinate amounts of time.

最后，另一个积极的一面，通常在后期康复阶段实现，是能够以最健康和最少创伤的方式处理正常疼痛的能力。这里的正常疼痛，指的是人类在与失去、疾病、金钱问题、时间压力等遭遇时，时而经历的存在性疼痛。这样的痛苦遭遇可能会产生愤怒、悲伤、恐惧和抑郁等情绪反应。普通人尚未学会如何用言语表达和消化对这些事件的感受。这导致他们在痛苦的情感状态中停滞不前，尤其是抑郁，持续时间过长。
