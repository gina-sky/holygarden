\*\*Signs Of Recovering

恢复的迹象\*\*

Effective recovery work leads to an ongoing reduction of emotional flashbacks. Over time, with enough practice, you become more proficient at managing triggered states. This in turn results in flashbacks occurring less often, less intensely and less enduringly.

有效的恢复工作会导致情绪闪回的持续减少。随着时间的推移，经过足够的练习，你将更加擅长管理被触发状态。这反过来又导致闪回发生的频率降低、强度减弱和持续时间缩短。

Another key sign of recovering is that your critic begins to shrink and lose its dominance over your psyche. As it shrinks, your user-friendly ego has room to grow and to develop the kind of mindfulness that recognizes when the critic has taken over. This in turn allows you to progressively reject the critic’s perfectionistic and drasticizing processes. More and more, you stop persecuting yourself for normal foibles. Additionally, you perseverate less in disappointment about other people’s minor miscues.

恢复的另一个关键迹象是，你的批评家开始缩小并失去对你心理的统治地位。随着它的缩小，你友好的自我有了成长和发展的空间，以及一种能够认识到批评家何时接管的心智。这反过来又让你能够逐渐拒绝批评家的完美主义和极端化过程。你越来越不再因为自己的正常小错误而自我迫害。此外，你在对他人小错误的失望上也不再固执己见。

[[null|]]A further sign of recovering is a gradual increase in your ability to relax. With this comes an increasing ability to resist overreacting from a triggered position. This further allows you to use your fight, flight, freeze and fawn instincts in healthy and non-self-destructive ways. This means you only fight back when under real attack, only flee when odds are insurmountable, only freeze when you need to go into acute observation mode, and only fawn when it is appropriate to be self-sacrificing.

进一步恢复的迹象是你放松能力的逐渐提高。随着这一点，你抵抗从触发位置过度反应的能力也在增强。这进一步使你能够以健康和非自我毁灭的方式使用你的战斗、逃跑、冻结和讨好本能。这意味着你只有在真正受到攻击时才反击，只有在胜算无法逆转时才逃跑，只有在需要进入急性观察模式时才冻结，只有在适当自我牺牲时才讨好。

An alternative way of describing this decrease in overreacting is that you have a good balance between the polar opposites of fight and fawn. As this becomes increasingly realized, you vacillate healthily between asserting your own needs and compromising with the needs of others.

描述这种过度反应减少的另一种方式是，你在战斗和讨好这两种截然相反的行为之间保持了良好的平衡。随着这一点越来越被认识到，你健康地在坚持自己的需求和妥协他人的需求之间摇摆。

A further example of decreased reactivity is seen in a more balanced movement between the polar opposites of flight and freeze. This manifests as an improving equilibrium between doing and being, between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system arousal, and between left and right-brain processing. The importance of balancing the fight-fawn and flight-freeze polarities within yourself is explored in greater detail at the end of [[6. What is My Trauma Type_|chapter 6]].

进一步减少反应性的例子可以在飞行和冻结这两种极性之间更加平衡的运动中看到。这表现为行动和存在之间的平衡得到改善，以及交感神经系统和副交感神经系统兴奋之间的平衡，以及左右脑处理之间的平衡。在第 6 章的结尾，更详细地探讨了在自身内部平衡战斗-恐惧和飞行-冻结极性的重要性。

Deep-level recovery is also evidenced by you becoming gradually more relaxed in safe enough company. This in turn leads to an increasing capacity to be more authentic and vulnerable in trustworthy relationships. With enough grace, this may then culminate in you acquiring an intimate, mutually supportive relationship where each of you can be there for the other through thick and thin.

深层恢复还体现在你在足够安全的陪伴下逐渐变得更加放松。这反过来又导致你在值得信赖的关系中更加真实和脆弱的能力不断增强。有了足够的优雅，这可能会最终导致你获得一种亲密的、相互支持的关系，你们中的每一个都可以在困难时期为对方提供支持。

Advanced recovery also correlates with letting go of the salvation fantasy that you will never have another flashback. Giving up the salvation fantasy is another one of those two steps forward, one step backward processes. We typically have to wrestle with denial a great deal to increasingly accept the unfair reality that we will never be totally flashback-free. Unless we do however, we impair our [[null|]]ability to easily recognize and quickly respond to flashbacks from a position of self-compassion, self-soothing and self-protection.

高级恢复也与放弃“你永远不会再次出现闪回”的救赎幻想有关。放弃救赎幻想是那种两步前进，一步后退的过程之一。我们通常必须与否认进行大量斗争，才能越来越接受这个不公平的现实：我们永远不会完全摆脱闪回。然而，如果我们不这样做，我们将损害自己从自我同情、自我安抚和自我保护的位置轻松识别和快速应对闪回的能力。
