**The Stages Of Recovering  
  
恢复的阶段**

Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some degree progressive. It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps us understand that we have Cptsd. This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.  
  
尽管我们经常同时在工作恢复的许多层面上，但恢复在某种程度上是渐进的。它从认知层面开始，当心理教育和正念帮助我们理解我们患有创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）。这种觉醒然后使我们能够学习如何接近解构创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的各种破坏生活的动态的旅程。

Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic. Some survivors will need to do a great deal of work on this level before they can move down to the emotional layer of work which is learning how to grieve effectively.  
  
仍然在认知层面，我们迈出下一步，进行长期的工作，缩小批评的声音。一些幸存者需要在这个层面上做大量的工作，才能向下移动到情感层面，这是学习如何有效地哀悼。

The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of recovery work. This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world. At this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem.  
  
童年失去的悲痛阶段可能持续几年。在悲痛方面取得足够进步后，幸存者自然会进入下一阶段的恢复工作。这涉及到通过悲痛我们失去的世界安全感来克服恐惧。在这个阶段，我们也学会通过悲痛我们自尊心的丧失来克服我们的有毒羞愧。

As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address the core issue of our trauma – the abandonment depression itself. Work here involves releasing the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression via the somatic work discussed in [[12. The Map_ Managing the Abandonment Depression|chapter 12]]. This work culminates with learning to compassionately support ourselves through our experiences of depression.  
  
随着我们在这类深层哀悼方面的熟练程度提高，我们就准备好解决我们创伤的核心问题——被遗弃的抑郁本身。在这里的工作涉及通过第 12 章中讨论的躯体工作，释放我们身体对被遗弃的抑郁的防御和生理反应。这项工作最终以学会通过抑郁的经历来同情地支持自己而告终。

Finally, as we will learn more about in [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]], many survivors need some relational help in achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-exacerbating defenses.  
  
最后，正如我们在第 13 章中将了解到的那样，许多幸存者在分解我们旧有的加剧痛苦的防御层所涉及的复杂任务时，需要一些关系上的帮助。
