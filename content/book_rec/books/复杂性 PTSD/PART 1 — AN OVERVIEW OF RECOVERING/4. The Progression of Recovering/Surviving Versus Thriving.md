**Surviving Versus Thriving  
  
生存与繁荣**

Recovery involves learning to handle unpredictable shifts in our inner emotional weather.  
  
康复涉及学会应对我们内心情绪天气的不可预测的变化。

Perhaps the ultimate dimension of this is what I call the Surviving ![](content/book_rec/books/复杂性%20PTSD/images/00002.jpeg)Thriving continuum.  
  
或许这是这种变化的终极维度，我称之为“生存与繁荣的连续体”。

Before we enter into recovery, it may feel like life is nothing but a struggle to survive. However, when recovery progresses enough, we begin to have some experiences of feeling like we are thriving. These may start out as feelings of optimism, hopefulness and certainty that we are indeed recovering.  
  
在我们进入康复之前，可能会觉得生活不过是一场生存的挣扎。然而，当康复进展到一定程度时，我们开始有一些感觉我们正在蓬勃发展的经历。这些可能最初是乐观、充满希望和确信我们确实正在康复的感觉。

And then, the bottom inevitably drops out because recovery is never all forward progress. Oh so unfairly, we are back to feeling that we can barely survive. To make matters worse, we are amnesiac that we even had a respite from surviving. Another flashback has hit and we polarize back onto the surviving end of the continuum. We are stuck in the anxious and deadened feelings of the abandonment mélange.  
  
然后，底部不可避免地跌落，因为恢复永远不会全是前进。如此不公平，我们又回到了几乎无法生存的感觉。更糟糕的是，我们甚至忘记了曾经有过一段生存的喘息时间。又一闪回袭来，我们又回到了连续体的生存一端。我们陷入了被遗弃的焦虑和麻木的感觉中。

In survival mode, even the most trivial and normally easy task can feel excruciatingly difficult. As in childhood, it is all feels just too hard. And if the flashback is especially intense, Thanatos may start knocking down the door. _Thanatos_ is the death urge described by Freud and in a flashback it corresponds with the suicidal ideation we looked at in [[1. The Journey of Recovering From Cptsd|chapter 1]].  
  
在生存模式中，即使是微不足道且通常容易的任务也会感觉痛苦不堪。就像童年时一样，一切都感觉太难了。如果闪回特别强烈，塔纳托斯可能会开始敲门。塔纳托斯是弗洛伊德描述的死亡冲动，在闪回中它与我们在第一章中看到的自杀想法相对应。

Once again, it is important to repeat that this feeling-state is a flashback to the worst times in childhood when our will to live was so compromised. As mindfulness improves we can recognize suicidal ideation as evidence of a flashback and begin to rescue ourselves with the [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]] flashback management steps.  
  
再次强调，重要的是要重复这一点，这种情感状态是对童年最糟糕时期的闪回，那时我们的生存意志受到了严重损害。随着正念的提升，我们可以将自杀念头视为闪回的证据，并开始使用第 8 章的闪回管理步骤来拯救自己。

[[null|]]As recovery progresses, polarizations back into survival mode do not take us to the utter despair end of the continuum so often. Nonetheless survival mode can still feel pretty awful, especially when it is characterized by high anxiety or immobilizing depression.  
  
随着恢复的进展，回归生存模式并不经常把我们带到连续体的绝望尽头。尽管如此，生存模式仍然可能感觉非常糟糕，尤其是当它以高焦虑或麻痹的抑郁为特征时。

Being in survival is especially difficult during those times when flashback management is less effective, and feelings that life is a struggle can hang on for days and even weeks. This is the territory where flashbacks morph into extended regressions.  
  
在生存期间，尤其是在闪回管理效果不佳的时候，尤其困难。生活是一场斗争的感觉可能会持续数天甚至数周。这就是闪回转变为长期退行的领域。

I believe regressions are sometimes a call from our psyche to address important developmental arrests. In this case, it is the need to learn unrelenting self-acceptance during a period of extended difficulty. It is also the need to develop a staunch and unyielding sense of self-protection. This fundamental instinct of fiery willingness to defend ourselves from unfairness needs to strengthen progressively so that we can withstand inner critic attacks.  
  
我相信，有时回归是我们心理在呼唤我们解决重要的发育停滞。在这种情况下，这是在一段漫长的困难时期学习不懈的自我接纳的需要。这同样是发展坚定而不可动摇的自我保护感的需要。这种从火焰般愿意捍卫自己免受不公平对待的基本本能需要逐步加强，以便我们能抵御内心的批评攻击。

Moreover we can grow in our ability to survive “survival” by using the [[13. A Relational Appoach to Healing Abandonment|chapter 13]] mindfulness techniques to practice and build enduring self-compassion. Moreover, if we are far enough along in recovery to have a safe ally, we can enlist their support to help us verbally ventilate out our pain at being stuck in survival.  
  
此外，我们可以通过使用第 13 章的冥想技巧来练习和建立持久的自我同情，从而提高我们的生存能力。此外，如果我们已经恢复到足够安全的地步，有了一个可靠的盟友，我们可以请他们支持我们，帮助我们用言语宣泄在生存困境中的痛苦。

Temptations can be great at such times to revert to the less functional ways of self-soothing that we learned when we younger. Depending on your 4F type this commonly manifests as increased eating, substance abuse, working, sleeping and/or sexually acting out.  
  
诱惑可能很大，让人回归到我们年轻时学会的不那么有效的自我安慰方式。根据你的 4F 类型，这通常表现为增加进食、物质滥用、工作、睡眠和/或性行为。

Sometimes we are triggered into self-medicating in this way because we are desperately trying to keep ourselves on the thriving end of the continuum. Desperately clinging to thriving is a hard impulse to resist, even when we are in reality way past its expiration date.  
  
有时我们之所以会以这种方式自我治疗，是因为我们拼命地试图让自己保持在连续体的繁荣一端。拼命地追求繁荣是一种难以抗拒的冲动，即使在我们实际上已经远远超过了它的保质期。

Yet as recovery and mindfulness increase we begin to notice that this type of self-medicating indicates that we are in a survival-flashback. We are no longer authentically on the thriving end of [[null|]]the continuum. We have compounded our regression, by regressing further - by self-medicating to unnaturally prolong a preferred experience. At such times, we benefit most by reinvoking our intention to practice self-acceptance – by recommitting to being there for ourselves no matter where we are on the continuum.  
  
然而，随着恢复和正念的增加，我们开始注意到这种自我疗愈表明我们处于生存闪回状态。我们不再真正处于连续体的繁荣一端。我们通过进一步退步——通过自我疗愈来不自然地延长一个偏好的体验——而加剧了我们的退化。在这样的时刻，我们最受益的是重新唤起我们练习自我接纳的意图——无论我们在连续体的哪个位置，都重新承诺为自己在那里。

As bears repeating, all human beings are existentially challenged to handle disappointing shifts out of thriving into surviving. We survivors however have greater difficulties handling these transitions because we were abandoned for so long at the surviving end of the continuum. Yet as our recovery progresses, we can learn to become increasingly self-supportive in times of being stuck in survival.  
  
正如需要反复强调的那样，所有人类都面临着从繁荣到生存的失望转变的生存挑战。然而，我们这些幸存者处理这些转变却更加困难，因为我们在这条连续体的生存端被遗弃了太久。然而，随着我们的恢复进展，我们可以学会在陷入生存困境时越来越自给自足。
