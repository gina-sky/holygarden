\*\*Difficulties In Identifying The Signs Of Recovering

识别恢复迹象的困难\*\*

Some readers may work on their recovery for a long time, and erroneously and shamefully feel they are not making any progress. Because of the all-or-none thinking that typically accompanies Cptsd, survivors in the early stages of recovery often fail to notice or validate their own actual progress.

一些读者可能长时间致力于恢复，却错误地、羞愧地觉得自己没有任何进步。由于 Cptsd 通常伴随的全有或全无的思维，恢复初期的幸存者往往未能注意到或验证他们自己的实际进步。

If we do not notice the degrees of our own improvement in our recovery work, we are in great danger of giving up on recovering. Because of black-and-white thinking, we can regularly fall into the trap of not acknowledging and valuing what we are actually accomplishing. Perfectionistic dismissal of improvement that is not 100% is common in early recovery.

如果我们没有注意到自己在恢复工作中的进步程度，我们就有很大危险放弃恢复。由于黑白思维，我们经常会陷入不承认和重视我们所取得的实际成就的陷阱。在早期恢复中，完美主义地否定非 100%的进步是常见的。

Here are some common areas where I see that recovering survivors fail to notice and self-validate their progressive degrees of improvement.

以下是一些我观察到恢复中的幸存者未能注意到和自我验证他们渐进式改进的常见领域。

1.  Less intense launching into a 4F response
    强度较低的 4F 反应启动
2.  Increasing resistance to the critic
    对批评的抵抗力增强
3.  Increased Mindfulness about flashbacks or inner critic attacks
    对闪回或内心批评攻击的警觉性提高
4.  [[null|]]Increased time feeling good enough about yourself
    自我感觉良好的时间增加
5.  Progress in meeting arrested developments listed in [[2. Levels of Recovering|chapter 2]]
    实现第二章中列出的停滞发展的进展
6.  Decreased overeating or use of self-medicating substances
    减少过度进食或使用自我药疗物质
7.  Increased experiences of good enough relating with others
    与他人建立良好关系的体验增加
8.  Decrease in the painfulness and intensity of flashback feelings
    减少闪回感受的痛苦和强度

In terms of number 3 above, it is important to note that even when mindfulness does not immediately terminate a flashback or critic attack, noticing and identifying these Cptsd phenomena is more progressive than just being blindly lost in them. Moreover, ongoing recognition makes effective ameliorative action more accessible. It makes us increasingly likely to remember to use the flashback management steps listed in [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]].

关于上述第 3 点，重要的是要注意，即使正念不能立即终止闪回或批评攻击，注意到并识别这些创伤后应激障碍现象也比盲目陷入其中更为进步。此外，持续的识别使有效的改善行动更加容易实现。这使得我们更有可能记住使用第 8 章中列出的闪回管理步骤。

Furthermore, it is important that we notice the gradually decreasing intensity of the flashback feelings of anxiety, shame and depression. In this regard, social anxiety can gradually reduce along a continuum that stretches from panicky withdrawal... to a more tolerable social discomfort... to periods of social ease. Additionally, depression can gradually diminish along a continuum that stretches from paralyzing despair... to anhedonia – an inability to enjoy normal life pleasures... to a state of tired, and relatively unmotivated peacefulness. Of course both these processes typically improve at a vacillating, back-and-forth rate.

此外，我们注意到闪回中焦虑、羞愧和抑郁感的逐渐减弱也很重要。在这方面，社交焦虑可以逐渐减少，沿着从恐慌性退缩...到更可忍受的社交不适...再到社交轻松的连续体。此外，抑郁也可以逐渐减少，沿着从麻痹的绝望...到享乐缺失——无法享受正常生活的乐趣...到疲惫且相对缺乏动力的平和状态。当然，这两个过程通常以摇摆不定、来回波动的速度改善。

As I write this I feel some old sadness about the many decades that I judged my emotional tone and mood as either good or bad in a very all-or-nothing way. If I was not feeling very good than I felt as if everything was really bad. And since feeling very good is something most human beings only get to experience a relatively small proportion of the time, my perception of feeling bad became a much more dominant experience than was necessary. In fact, mildly unpleasant feeling typically morphed me quickly into feeling terrible via shame-tinged, all-or-none thinking.

当我写下这些时，我感到一些关于过去几十年我以非黑即白的方式判断我的情绪调调和心情的旧日悲伤。如果我感觉不好，那么我就会觉得一切都很糟糕。由于感觉非常好是大多数人只能相对较少地体验到的事情，我对感觉糟糕的认知变得比必要的更为突出。事实上，轻微的不愉快通常通过带有羞愧色彩的全有或全无的思维方式迅速让我感到非常糟糕。

[[null|]]I am so grateful for the life-changing epiphany that lead me to trade in my old primary aspiration of “Celebration” for my new one of “Serenity.”

我非常感激这个改变我生活的顿悟，让我将我旧有的主要愿望“庆祝”换成新的“宁静”。

Inner critic thought processes refute signs of progress whenever a new flashback occurs, no matter how much less intense it is than before. Every recurrence of feeling shame, fear or depression is interpreted as proof that nothing has changed, even when there are increasing periods of not being triggered.

内心批评者的思维过程会在每次新的闪回发生时反驳进步的迹象，无论它比之前少多少强度。每一次感到羞愧、恐惧或抑郁的复发都被解读为证明没有任何改变，即使在不被触发的时间段越来越多。

The critic’s black-and-white assessment is: “Either I’m cured or I’m still hopelessly defective.” And once you identify with your critic’s pronouncement of defectiveness, you are off and spiraling downward into a full-fledged flashback - captured once again in the ice veneer of toxic shame that freezes one in the Cptsd stranglehold of helplessness and hopelessness.

批评家的黑白评价是：“要么我已经痊愈，要么我仍然无可救药。”一旦你认同了批评家对缺陷的宣判，你就会开始螺旋式下降，陷入彻底的回忆——再次被捕捉在冰封的毒性羞耻感中，这种羞耻感将你困在创伤后应激障碍的无力感和绝望的束缚中。
