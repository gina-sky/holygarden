**Optimal Stress  
  
最佳压力**

The quest to ongoingly grow and evolve out of my childhood trauma sometimes becomes more embraceable to me when I remember the poet’s words: “He not busy being born is busy dying.” In fact, some of the latest research in neuroscience suggests that we actually need a modicum of stress in our life. This type of stress is called optimal stress.  
  
当我回想起诗人的话：“他不是忙于出生，就是在忙于死亡。”时，我有时会更容易接受从童年创伤中不断成长和发展的追求。事实上，最新的神经科学研究表明，我们实际上在生活中需要一定量的压力。这种类型的压力被称为最佳压力。

_Optimal stress_ is the balanced, moderate amount of stress that appears to be necessary to grow the new neurons and neuronal connections that correlate with keeping the brain healthy. Research shows that just as too much stress creates a biochemical condition that damages neurons in the brain, too little stress leads to the atrophy, death and lack of replacement of old neurons. This is why lifelong learning is widely recognized as one of the key practices necessary to avoid Alzheimer’s disease.  
  
最佳压力是保持大脑健康所必需的平衡、适度的压力量，这种压力有助于新神经元的生长和与保持大脑健康相关的神经元连接。研究表明，过多的压力会形成一种生化条件，损害大脑中的神经元，而压力过少则会导致旧神经元的萎缩、死亡和缺乏替代。这就是为什么终身学习被广泛认为是避免阿尔茨海默病的必要关键实践之一。

In my opinion, lifelong recovering is an exalted subset of lifelong learning. I believe that optimal stress is frequently attained when we practice the behaviors that remedy our developmental arrests. Examples of this include reading self-help books, attending [[null|]]self-improvement workshops, working at deeper self-discovery through journaling, or struggling to be more vulnerable and authentic in a therapy session or an evolving relationship. Moreover, it might be that minor flashbacks sometimes function as optimal stress. I certainly know a number of long term recoverees who seem to be evolving and becoming sharper in their old age.  
  
在我看来，终身康复是终身学习的一个高尚的子集。我相信，当我们实践那些治疗我们发展停滞的行为时，我们经常能达到最佳的压力水平。这包括阅读自助书籍、参加自我提升研讨会、通过写日记进行更深入的自我发现，或者在治疗会议或不断发展的关系中努力变得更加脆弱和真诚。此外，可能是一些微小的闪回有时充当最佳压力。我确实认识一些长期康复者，他们在老年时似乎在发展和变得更加敏锐。
