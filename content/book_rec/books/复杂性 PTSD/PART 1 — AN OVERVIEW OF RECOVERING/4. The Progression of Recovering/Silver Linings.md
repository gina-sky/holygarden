\*\*SILVER LININGS

银色 lining\*\*

We live in an emotionally impoverished culture, and those who stick with a long term recovery process are often rewarded with emotional intelligence far beyond the norm. This is somewhat paradoxical, as survivors of childhood trauma are initially injured more grievously in their emotional natures than those in the general population.

我们生活在一个情感匮乏的文化中，那些坚持长期康复过程的人往往获得超越常人的情商。这在某种程度上是矛盾的，因为童年创伤的幸存者在情感上最初受到的伤害比普通人群更为严重。

The silver lining in this, however, is that many of us were forced to consciously address our suffering because our wounding was so much more severe. Those who work an effective recovery program not only recover significantly from emotional damage, but also evolve out of the emotional impoverishment of the general society. One of my clients described this as becoming “way more emotionally intelligent than the ‘normies’.”

然而，其中的转机是，由于我们的伤害如此严重，我们中的许多人被迫有意识地面对我们的痛苦。那些参与有效康复计划的人不仅从情感伤害中显著恢复，而且摆脱了社会普遍的情感贫困。我的一个客户将这描述为“比‘普通人’更加情绪智能”。

Perhaps the greatest reward of improved emotional intelligence is seen in a greater capacity for deeper intimacy. Emotional intelligence is a foundational ingredient of relational intelligence – a type of intelligence that is also frequently diminished in the general populace.

或许，提高情商最大的回报就是能够拥有更深层次的亲密关系。情商是关系智能的基础成分——这种智能在普通人中也常常被削弱。

As stated earlier, intimacy is greatly enhanced when two people dialogue about all aspects of their experience. This is especially true when they transcend taboos against full emotional communication. Feelings of love, appreciation and gratitude are naturally enhanced when we reciprocally show our full selves - confident or afraid, loving or alienated, proud or embarrassed. What an incredible achievement it is when any two of us create such an authentic and supportive relationship! Many of the most intimate relationships [[null|]]that I have seen are between people who have done a great deal of freeing themselves from the negative legacies of their upbringings.

如前所述，当两个人就他们经历的所有方面进行对话时，亲密感会大大增强。这在他们超越对全面情感交流的禁忌时尤其如此。当我们相互展示我们的全部自我——自信或害怕、爱或疏远、骄傲或尴尬时，爱情、欣赏和感激之情自然会得到增强。当我们中的任何两个人创造出这样真实和支持的关系时，这是一项多么了不起的成就！我看到的大多数最亲密的关系，都是在那些做了大量摆脱成长过程中负面遗产的人之间。
