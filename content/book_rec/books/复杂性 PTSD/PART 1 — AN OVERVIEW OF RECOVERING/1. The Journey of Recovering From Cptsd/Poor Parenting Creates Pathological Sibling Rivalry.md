**Poor Parenting Creates Pathological Sibling Rivalry  
  
糟糕的育儿方式导致病态的兄弟姐妹竞争**

Like many children in Cptsd-engendering families, Maude could not turn to her siblings for comfort because her parents unconsciously practiced the “divide and conquer” principle. Her parents modeled and encouraged sarcasm and constant fault finding among the children. Moreover, interactions of cooperation or warmth were routinely ridiculed.  
  
像许多在 Cptsd（创伤后应激障碍）家庭中长大的孩子一样，Maude 无法向她的兄弟姐妹寻求安慰，因为她的父母无意识地实践了“分而治之”的原则。她的父母在孩子们之间树立了讽刺和不断找错的榜样，并鼓励这种行为。此外，合作或温暖的互动通常会被嘲笑。

[[null|]]Sibling rivalry is further reinforced in dysfunctional families by the fact that all the children are subsisting on minimal nurturance, and are therefore without resources to give to each other. Moreover, competition for the little their parents have to give creates even fiercer rivalries.  
  
兄弟姐妹之间的竞争在功能失调的家庭中进一步加剧，因为所有的孩子都只能依赖最低限度的养育，因此没有资源可以互相给予。此外，为了争夺父母所给予的少量东西，竞争变得更加激烈。

Two years later, Sean was born. At first, it seemed as if he was destined for the same lost, dissociated destiny as Maude, but as he matured he fell into the role of “gifted child” as described by Alice Miller in _The Drama of the Gifted Child_.  
  
两年后，肖恩出生了。起初，他似乎注定要和莫德一样走向失落和疏离的命运，但随着他的成长，他落入了爱丽丝·米勒在《天才儿童的戏剧》中所描述的“天才儿童”的角色。

Sean’s inborn gift coming into this life was his compassion and his sense that if he studied his mother enough and figured out what she needed, he could provide for her needs. This would sometimes calm her down and make her less dangerous, bitter and sarcastic.  
  
肖恩来到这个世界时的天赋是他的同情心以及他感觉，如果他足够了解他的母亲并弄清楚她的需求，他就能满足她的需求。这有时会让她平静下来，减少她的危险、苦涩和讽刺。

Over the years Sean honed this skill and could almost clairvoyantly anticipate her sore spots, moods and preferences. Sometimes it seemed he knew what she needed before she did, and with practice he became adept at defusing her anger and sometimes even gaining morsels of her approval.  
  
多年来，肖恩磨练了这项技能，几乎可以先知般地预见到她的痛处、情绪和偏好。有时他似乎在她之前就知道她需要什么，通过练习，他变得擅长平息她的愤怒，有时甚至能获得她的一丝认可。

Synchronistically, his mother realized she was getting old and that her alcohol-ravaged husband would likely precede her. Not wanting to be alone, she exploited his compassionate nature and primed him for domestic service for as long as she would need it. Sean remained living at home until his mother’s death released him from emotional captivity at the age of twenty-nine. This was the codependent enslavement we will explore more in [[7. Recovering From Trauma-Based Codependency|chapter 7]].  
  
同步地，他的母亲意识到自己正在变老，而她那因酒精而受摧残的丈夫可能会先她而去。不想独自一人，她利用了他的同情心，并为他做好了长期从事家务的准备。肖恩一直住在家里，直到他母亲去世，他在 29 岁时才从情感束缚中解脱出来。这是我们将在第 7 章中更深入探讨的共生奴役。

A friend of Sean’s who knew all the siblings as adults, marveled that it seemed as if each had different parents.  
  
肖恩的一个成年后认识所有兄弟姐妹的朋友，惊奇地发现他们似乎各有不同的父母。

Finally, it is also important to note that the scapegoat role does not fall exclusively on the flight type as it did with Carol. It can be bestowed on anyone of the 4F types depending on the given family. The scapegoating role can also shift over time from one person to another and each parent or sibling may choose a different scapegoat.  
  
最后，需要注意的是，替罪羊的角色并不像卡罗尔那样仅限于逃避型。它可以根据特定的家庭赋予 4F 类型中的任何人。替罪羊的角色也可以随着时间的推移从一个人转移到另一个人，每个父母或兄弟姐妹都可能选择不同的替罪羊。

[[6. What is My Trauma Type_|Chapters 6]] and [^7] explore each of the 4F’s and their corresponding defensive structures in greater detail. These chapters will also help you determine your key 4F defense, and help you address issues that are more specific to your type of Cptsd.  
  
第 6 章和第 7 章将更详细地探讨 4F 及其相应的防御结构。这些章节还将帮助您确定您的主要 4F 防御机制，并帮助您解决更具体于您类型 Cptsd 的问题。
