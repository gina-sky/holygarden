THE JOURNEY OF RECOVERING FROM CPTSD

《从创伤后应激障碍中恢复的旅程》

I wrote this book from the perspective of someone who has Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \[Cptsd\], and who has experienced a great reduction of symptoms over the years. I also wrote it from the viewpoint of someone who has discovered many silver linings in the long, windy, bumpy road of recovering from Cptsd. I have also seen this type of recovering in a number of my friends and many long term clients.

我写这本书是从一个患有复杂性创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的人的视角出发的，这个人多年来症状有了显著减少。我也从一个人发现 Cptsd 恢复之路漫长、曲折、坎坷中许多积极面的视角来写这本书。我还看到我的许多朋友和许多长期客户也有这种恢复的经历。

First, the good news about Cptsd. It is a learned set of responses, and a failure to complete numerous important developmental tasks. This means that it is environmentally, not genetically, caused. In other words, unlike most of the diagnoses it is confused with, it is neither inborn nor characterological. As such, it is learned. It is not inscribed in your DNA. It is a disorder caused by nurture \[or rather the lack of it\] not nature.

首先，关于 Cptsd 的好消息。它是一套习得性反应，以及未能完成许多重要的发展任务。这意味着它是环境因素造成的，而不是遗传因素。换句话说，与它混淆的多数诊断不同，它既不是天生的，也不是性格上的。因此，它是习得的。它不是刻在你的 DNA 上的。它是由养育（或者说养育的缺乏）而不是自然造成的失调。

[[null|]]This is especially good news because what is learned can be unlearned and vice versa. What was not provided by your parents can now be provided by yourself and others.

这是一个特别好的消息，因为习得的东西可以取消习得，反之亦然。你父母没有提供的东西现在可以由你自己和他人提供。

Recovery from Cptsd typically has important self-help and relational components. The relational piece can come from authors, friends, partners, teachers, therapists, therapeutic groups or any combination of these. I like to call this _reparenting by committee_.

从 Cptsd 中恢复通常需要重要的自我帮助和人际关系因素。人际关系部分可以来自作者、朋友、伴侣、教师、治疗师、治疗小组或这些组合中的任何一种。我倾向于称这种由委员会代为抚养为“委员会代养”。

I must emphasize, however, that some survivors of Cptsdengendering families were so thoroughly betrayed by their parents, that it may be a long time, if ever, before they can trust another human being enough to engage in relational healing work. When this is the case, pets, books and online therapeutic websites can provide significant relational healing.

我必须强调，然而，一些来自 Cptsdgendering 家庭的幸存者被他们的父母彻底背叛，以至于他们可能需要很长时间，甚至永远，才能足够信任另一个人去参与关系修复工作。在这种情况下，宠物、书籍和在线治疗网站可以提供重要的关系修复。

This book describes a multimodal treatment approach to Cptsd. It is oriented toward the most prevalent kind of Cptsd, the kind that comes from growing up in a severely abusive and/or neglectful family. In this vein, the book describes a journey of healing the damage that occurs when you suffer traumatizing abuse and abandonment. Traumatizing abuse and abandonment can occur on verbal, emotional, spiritual, and/or physical levels. Moreover, sexual abuse is especially traumatizing.

本书描述了一种针对创伤后应激障碍的多模式治疗方法。它主要针对最常见的 Cptsd 类型，即来自在严重虐待和/或忽视的家庭中成长的人。在这方面，本书描述了在遭受创伤性虐待和遗弃时产生的伤害的治愈之旅。创伤性虐待和遗弃可能发生在言语、情感、精神和/或身体层面。此外，性虐待尤其具有创伤性。

I believe that we have an epidemic of traumatizing families. Current estimates posit that one in three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before they enter adulthood, and recent statistics from The Kim Foundation report that 26% of Americans over 18 have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.

我相信我们有一个创伤家庭的流行病。目前的估计显示，三分之一的女孩和五分之一的男孩在成年之前都遭受过性虐待，而来自金基金会的最新统计数据显示，26%的 18 岁以上美国人被诊断出患有精神疾病。

When abuse or neglect is severe enough, any one category of it can cause the child to develop Cptsd. This is true even in the case of emotional neglect if both parents collude in it, as we will see in [[5. What if I Was Never Hit_|chapter 5]]. When abuse and neglect is multidimensional, the severity of the Cptsd worsens accordingly.

当虐待或忽视严重到一定程度时，任何一种类型都可能导致孩子发展出创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）。即使在情感忽视的情况下，如果父母双方都参与其中，也是如此，正如我们在第五章中将会看到的。当虐待和忽视是多维度的，Cptsd 的严重程度也会相应加剧。
