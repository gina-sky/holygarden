\*\*An Example Of An Emotional Flashback

一个情感闪回的例子\*\*

As I write this I recall the first emotional flashback I was ever able to identify, although I did not identify it until about ten years after it occurred. At the time of the event, I was living with my first serious partner. The honeymoon phase of our relationship came to a screeching halt when she unexpectedly started yelling at me for something I no longer recall.

当我写下这些时，我想起了我第一次能够识别的情感闪回，尽管我直到事件发生大约十年后才意识到这一点。在事件发生时，我和我的第一位严肃的伴侣住在一起。我们关系的蜜月期突然戛然而止，因为她突然对我大喊大叫，原因我现在已经不记得了。

[[null|]]What I do most vividly recall was how the yelling felt. It felt like a fierce hot wind. I felt like I was being blown away – like my insides were being blown out, as a flame on a candle is blown out.

我记忆最深刻的是那种大喊的感觉。它感觉像一股狂热的热风。我感觉自己被吹走了——就像我的内在被吹散了，就像蜡烛上的火焰被吹灭一样。

Later, when I first heard about auras, I flashed back to this and felt like my aura had been completely stripped from me.

后来，当我第一次听说光环时，我回想起这件事，感觉我的光环被完全剥夺了。

At the time itself, I also felt completely disoriented, unable to speak, respond or even think. I felt terrified, shaky and very little. Somehow, I finally managed to totter to the door and get out of the house where I eventually slowly pulled myself together.

当时，我也感到完全迷失方向，无法说话、回应甚至思考。我感到恐惧、颤抖，非常渺小。不知怎么的，我终于蹒跚着走到门口，离开了房子，在那里我最终慢慢地恢复了过来。

As I said earlier, it took me ten years to figure out that this confusing and disturbing phenomenon was an intense emotional flashback. Some years later, I came to understand the nature of this type of regression. I realized it was a flashback to the hundreds of times my mother, in full homicidal visage, blasted me with her rage into terror, shame, dissociation and helplessness.

正如我之前所说，我花了十年时间才弄清楚这种令人困惑和不安的现象是一种强烈的情绪闪回。几年后，我了解了这种类型退行的本质。我意识到这是一种对数百次我母亲带着满脸杀气的愤怒，将我吓得惊恐、羞愧、解离和无助的闪回。

Emotional flashbacks are also accompanied by intense arousals of the fight/flight instinct, along with hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system, the half of the nervous system that controls arousal and activation. When fear is the dominant emotion in a flashback the person feels extremely anxious, panicky or even suicidal. When despair predominates, a sense of profound numbness, paralysis and desperation to hide may occur.

情绪闪回还伴随着强烈的战斗/逃跑本能的唤起，以及交感神经系统的过度激活，这是控制唤起和激活的神经系统的一半。当恐惧是闪回中的主导情绪时，人们会感到极度焦虑、恐慌甚至有自杀的念头。当绝望占主导地位时，可能会出现深刻的麻木、瘫痪和想要隐藏的绝望感。

A sense of feeling small, young, fragile, powerless and helpless is also commonly experienced in an emotional flashback, and all symptoms are typically overlaid with humiliating and crushing toxic shame.

一种感觉渺小、年轻、脆弱、无力和无助也在情感闪回中普遍体验，所有症状通常都叠加着羞辱和压倒性的有毒羞耻感。
