\*\*Suicidal Ideation

自杀意念\*\*

_Suicidal ideation_ is a common phenomenon in Cptsd, particularly during intense or prolonged flashbacks. Suicidal ideation is depressed thinking or fantasizing about wanting to die. It can range from active suicidality to passive suicidality.

自杀意念是创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）中的一种常见现象，尤其是在强烈的或持续的闪回期间。自杀意念是抑郁思维或幻想想要死亡。它可以从主动自杀倾向到被动自杀倾向不等。

_Passive suicidality_ is far more common with the Cptsd survivors who I have known, and it ranges from wishing you were dead to fantasizing about ways to end your life. When lost in suicidal ideation, the survivor may even pray to be delivered from this life, or fantasize about being taken by some calamitous act of fate. He may even think or obsess - without being serious - of stepping in front of a car or jumping off a building.

在我所认识的创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）幸存者中，被动自杀倾向更为常见，它从希望死去到幻想结束生命的方式不等。当陷入自杀意念时，幸存者甚至可能会祈祷逃离这个生活，或者幻想被命运中的某个灾难性事件带走。他甚至可能会想或沉迷——尽管并非认真——走到车前或从建筑物上跳下。

Fantasy typically ends, however, without a serious intent to kill yourself. This is as opposed to active suicidality where the person is actively proceeding in the direction of taking her life.

幻想通常在未认真考虑自杀的情况下结束。这与积极自杀倾向形成对比，后者的人正积极朝着结束自己生命的目标前进。

I am discussing passive suicidality because it does not merit the same kind of alarm as active suicidality. Passive suicidality is [[null|]]typically a flashback to early childhood when our abandonment was so profound, that it was natural for us to wish that God or somebody or something would just put an end to it all.

我在讨论被动自杀倾向，因为它不像积极自杀倾向那样值得引起同样的警觉。被动自杀倾向通常是对童年早期的一种回忆，那时我们的被遗弃感如此之深，以至于我们希望上帝或某个人或某件事能结束这一切。

When the survivor catches himself in a suicidal reverie, he will benefit from seeing it both as an emblem of how much pain he is in, and as a sign of a particularly intense flashback. This then can direct him to use the flashback management steps in [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]].

当幸存者发现自己陷入自杀幻想时，他应该将其视为自己痛苦程度的象征，以及一个特别强烈的回忆的迹象。这然后可以引导他使用第 8 章中提到的回忆管理步骤。

If however, flashback management does not help, and suicidality becomes increasingly active, please call the national suicide hot-line \[1-800-273-8255\] or visit [www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org), because this is a flashback that you may need help managing, and you will get good help there.

然而，如果回忆管理没有帮助，自杀倾向变得越来越积极，请拨打国家自杀热线\[1-800-273-8255\]或访问 www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org，因为这是一个你可能需要帮助管理的回忆，那里你可以得到良好的帮助。

Skilled therapists and caregivers learn to discriminate between active and passive suicidal ideation, and do not panic and catastrophize when encountering the latter. Instead, the counselor invites the survivor to explore his suicidal thoughts and feelings knowing that in most cases, verbal ventilation of the flashback pain underneath it will deconstruct the suicidality.

熟练的治疗师和护理人员学会区分主动和被动的自杀意念，当遇到后者时，他们不会恐慌和灾难化。相反，咨询师邀请幸存者探索他的自杀想法和感受，知道在大多数情况下，对背后闪回痛苦的口头宣泄将分解自杀意念。

In the much less common scenario of active suicidality, encouraging verbal ventilation will also help the therapist or helper discern if there is indeed a real risk and if action needs to be taken to protect the survivor.

在更少见的主动自杀意念场景中，鼓励口头宣泄也有助于治疗师或助手判断是否真的存在风险，以及是否需要采取措施保护幸存者。
