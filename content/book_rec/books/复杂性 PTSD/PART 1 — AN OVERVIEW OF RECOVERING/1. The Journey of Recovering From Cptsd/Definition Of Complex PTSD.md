**Definition Of Complex PTSD  
  
复杂型创伤后应激障碍的定义**

Cptsd is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder. It is delineated from this better known trauma syndrome by five of its most common and troublesome features: ==emotional flashbacks, toxic shame, self-abandonment, a vicious inner critic and social anxiety.==  
  
Cptsd 是一种更严重的创伤后应激障碍形式。它通过其五个最常见和麻烦的特征与更为人所知的创伤综合征区分开来：情绪闪回、有毒羞愧、自我放弃、恶毒的内心批评和社会焦虑。

_Emotional flashbacks_ are perhaps the most noticeable and characteristic feature of Cptsd. Survivors of traumatizing abandonment are extremely susceptibility to painful emotional flashbacks, which unlike ptsd do not typically have a visual component.  
  
情绪闪回可能是 Cptsd 最明显和典型的特征。遭受创伤性遗弃的幸存者对痛苦的情绪闪回极为敏感，与 ptsd 不同，这些闪回通常没有视觉成分。

Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions to the overwhelming feeling-states of being an abused/abandoned child. These feeling states can include overwhelming fear, shame, alienation, rage, grief and depression. They also include unnecessary triggering of our fight/flight instincts.  
  
情绪闪回是突然且常常是长时间的回归到被虐待/被遗弃的孩子的压倒性情感状态。这些情感状态可能包括压倒性的恐惧、羞耻、疏离、愤怒、悲伤和抑郁。它们还包括不必要的触发我们的战斗/逃跑本能。

I==t is important to state here that emotional flashbacks, like most things in life, are not all-or-none. Flashbacks can range in intensity from subtle to horrific. They can also vary in duration ranging from moments to weeks on end where they devolve into what many therapists call a regression.  ==
  
在此需要强调的是，情绪闪回，像生活中的许多事情一样，并非全有或全无。闪回的强度可以从微妙到恐怖不等。它们的持续时间也可以变化，从几分钟到连续几周，最终演变成许多治疗师所说的回归。

Finally, a more clinical and extensive definition of Cptsd can be found on p. 121 of Judith Herman’s seminal book, _Trauma and Recovery._  
  
最后，在 Judith Herman 的奠基性著作《创伤与恢复》的第 121 页上，可以找到对 Cptsd 的更临床和广泛的定义。
