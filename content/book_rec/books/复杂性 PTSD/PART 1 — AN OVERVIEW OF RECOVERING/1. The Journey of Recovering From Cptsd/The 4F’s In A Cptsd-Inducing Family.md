**The 4F’s In A Cptsd-Inducing Family  
  
Cptsd-Inducing Family 中的 4F**

Carol was the scapegoat of her family. Narcissistic and borderline parents typically choose at least one child to be the designated family scapegoat.  
  
Carol 是她家庭的替罪羊。自恋型和边缘型父母通常会选择至少一个孩子作为指定的家庭替罪羊。

_Scapegoating_ is the process by which a bully offloads and externalizes his pain, stress, and frustration by attacking a less powerful person. Typically scapegoating brings the bully some momentary relief. It does not however effectively metabolize or release his pain, and scapegoating soon resumes as the bully’s internal discomfort resurfaces.  
  
替罪羊机制是指一个欺凌者通过攻击一个较弱的人来转移和外部化自己的痛苦、压力和挫折的过程。通常，替罪羊机制会给欺凌者带来一些短暂的缓解。然而，它并不能有效地代谢或释放他的痛苦，当欺凌者内心的不适再次浮现时，替罪羊机制很快就会重新开始。

Wilhelm Reich, in his brilliant book _The Psychology of Fascism,_ explains how scapegoating occurs on a continuum that stretches from the persecution of the targeted child by a bullying parent to the horrific scapegoating of the Jews by the Nazi’s. In especially dysfunctional families like Carol’s, the scapegoating parent often organizes the rest of the family to also gang up on the scapegoat.  
  
Wilhelm Reich 在他的杰出著作《法西斯主义的心理学》中解释了替罪羊机制是如何在一个从被欺凌的父母针对目标孩子到纳粹对犹太人的可怕迫害的连续体上发生的。在像 Carol 那样的特别功能失调的家庭中，替罪羊的父母经常组织其他家庭成员一起对替罪羊进行围攻。

Carol discovered a great deal about her early childhood from watching home videos. Her parents were so narcissistically oblivious, that they unabashedly recorded many incidents of Carol being verbally and emotionally abused by them. This was usually in the background of recordings of the performances of their favorite child, her older brother. Severely narcissistic parents are rarely embarrassed by their aggressive behavior. They feel entitled to punish a child for anything that displeases them, no matter how unreasonable it might appear to an impartial observer.  
  
Carol 通过观看家庭录像发现了她早期童年的许多事情。她的父母如此自恋地无意识，以至于他们毫不羞愧地记录了许多 Carol 被他们言语和情感虐待的片段。这些通常是在他们最喜欢的孩子、她哥哥的表演录像的背景中。极度自恋的父母很少会因为他们的攻击性行为感到尴尬。他们认为有权因为任何令他们不高兴的事情惩罚孩子，无论这在无偏见的观察者看来有多么不合理。

Carols’ parents started in on her early by disdainfully blaming her for soiling her diaper before she was even one. By the time she was three, she had been so frequently punished for making noise while talking and playfully exploring her house, that her constant state of fear generated an ADHD-like condition in her.  
  
Carol 的父母从她很小的时候就开始责怪她，在她甚至还没有一岁的时候，就因为她尿湿了尿布而表示轻蔑。到她三岁的时候，她已经因为说话和玩耍时制造噪音而频繁受到惩罚，以至于她持续的状态恐惧产生了类似 ADHD 的症状。

Carol’s large backyard was her refuge where she would play with great gusto - climbing, running, cavorting, and building and [[null|]]ransacking villages that she made with her toys and leaves, grass, sticks and stones. She would busy herself from breakfast until supper, often forgetting to come in for lunch, which she thought in retrospect made life even easier for her mother, who never called her in to eat.  
  
Carol 的大后院是她避风的港湾，在那里她会充满热情地玩耍——攀爬、奔跑、嬉戏，用玩具和树叶、草、树枝和石头搭建和破坏村庄。她从早餐一直忙到晚餐，常常忘了吃午饭，回想起来，她觉得这使她的母亲生活更加轻松，因为母亲从未叫她吃饭。

One family video from this time was the straw that broke the camel’s back of Carol’s denial that her family was abusive. It showed her playing a game whereby she would repetitively smack herself hard on the hand and call herself a bad girl as she wobbled around the living room touching various knick-knacks. There was a considerable amount of footage that showed her parents and siblings roaring with mocking delight in the background.  
  
这一时期的家庭录像成了 Carol 否认家庭虐待的最后一根稻草。录像显示她玩一个游戏，反复用力打自己的手，边摇晃着在客厅里触摸各种小玩意儿，边称自己是个坏女孩。录像中有大量片段显示她的父母和兄弟姐妹在背景中大声嘲笑。

When contempt replaces the milk of human kindness at an early age, the child feels humiliated and overwhelmed. Too helpless to protest or even understand the unfairness of being abused, the child eventually becomes convinced that she is defective and fatally flawed. Frequently she comes to believe that she deserves her parents’ persecution.  
  
当在年幼时，恶意取代了人性的温暖，孩子会感到羞辱和不知所措。太过无助去抗议甚至无法理解被虐待的不公平，孩子最终会确信自己有缺陷，致命的缺陷。她常常会相信她应该得到父母的迫害。

When Carol was four, she “accidentally” fell out of a second story window. A few years later, she stepped out into the street in front of a car and was knocked to the ground. As an adult, she was convinced that both injuries contributed to her extremely painful, early onset scoliosis. She also believed that she was in so much pain, that she was unconsciously trying to end her life.  
  
当 Carol 四岁时，她“意外”地从二楼窗户掉下来。几年后，她走到一辆车前，被撞倒在地。作为一个成年人，她坚信这两次伤害导致了她极度痛苦的早期脊柱侧弯。她也认为，她如此痛苦，以至于她不自觉地试图结束自己的生命。

Fortunately for Carol, school eventually offered a glimmer of reprieve. A kindly third grade teacher perceived her intelligence, and praised her enough that she soon became an excellent student. Unfortunately, the terrible anxiety that she lived with 24/7 soon morphed into an obsessive/compulsive approach to school work. This, in turn, later manifested into a life-spoiling perfectionism and workaholism.  
  
幸运的是，对于 Carol 来说，学校最终给了她一线希望。一位和蔼的三年级老师注意到了她的聪明才智，并给予了她足够的赞扬，她很快成为了一名优秀的学生。不幸的是，她 24 小时都生活在可怕的焦虑中，这很快演变成了一种对学校工作的强迫性/强迫性方法。这反过来又后来表现为一种毁灭生活的完美主义和拼命工作。

Carol’s older brother, Bob, the favorite and hero of her parents was not molded with fear and rejection like Carol. Bob, the recipient [[null|]]of the parents’ narcissistic expectations, was shaped into a multidimensional achiever by their withdrawal of approval for less than perfect performances. He was then given tidbits of praise for outstanding accomplishments that would reflect positively on his parents. He was also enlisted to further scapegoat Carol, and as time went on outdid his parents in tormenting her.  
  
Carol 的大哥 Bob，是父母的心头好和英雄，他并没有像 Carol 那样被恐惧和排斥所塑造。Bob 是父母自恋期望的接受者，通过他们对不够完美的表现的撤销认可，被塑造成一个多面手的成功者。然后，他们会给予他一些表扬，以反映在他父母身上产生积极影响的成绩。他们还让他去进一步地责备 Carol，随着时间的推移，他在折磨她方面甚至超过了他的父母。

I believe there is an epidemic of sibling abuse that afflicts many dysfunctional families. Siblings in such families can traumatize the victim-scapegoat as severely as the parents. In families with checked out, disinterested parents, they can in fact be the chief sources of trauma. This is especially true in our culture where emotional neglect of children is rampant and where parents are routinely advised to let the kids “work it out themselves.” But how does a child who has half the strength of his older sibling work it out, and stop him from tormenting her without the aid of a stronger ally?  
  
我相信有一种兄弟虐待的流行病困扰着许多功能失调的家庭。在这样的家庭中，兄弟姐妹可以像父母一样严重地创伤受害者替罪羊。在父母冷漠、不感兴趣的家庭中，他们实际上可能是创伤的主要来源。这在我们的文化中尤其如此，儿童的情感忽视普遍存在，父母通常被建议让孩子“自己解决问题。”但是，一个只有哥哥一半力量的孩子如何自己解决问题，在没有更强盟友的帮助下阻止他折磨她呢？

Bob, himself, did not escape the pathological influence of his parents. Scapegoating became a habit for him, and he developed the narcissist’s sixth sense for identifying others whose families had victimized and used them as targets. Bob, hurting from his parents using him and holding him to perfectionistic standards, grew up to become a full-fledged narcissist and “control-freak”. He aggressively tried to mold his “loved” ones as he had been molded, and was working on whipping his fourth wife into shape at the time of Carol’s therapy.  
  
鲍勃自己也没有逃脱父母病理影响。他养成了替罪羊的习惯，并发展出自恋者的第六感，能识别那些家庭伤害并利用他们作为目标的人。鲍勃因父母利用他并对他持有完美主义标准而受伤，长大后成为了一名彻底的自恋者和“控制狂”。他试图像对待自己一样塑造他所“爱”的人，在卡罗尔接受治疗时，他正在努力将他的第四任妻子塑造成理想的样子。

Let us return to Carol. As an adolescent, her trauma was painfully reinforced by her surrounding community who so admired her brother’s accomplishments, that they joined the family in pathologizing Carol as a “bad seed”.  
  
让我们回到卡罗尔。作为一个青少年，她的创伤被周围社区痛苦地强化了，他们如此钦佩她哥哥的成就，以至于他们加入了家庭，将卡罗尔病理化为“坏种子”。

Unfortunately things deteriorated further for Carol as an adult, even though she had seemingly escaped from the family. Carol remained symbolically enthralled to the family by getting ensnared with narcissistic people who were just as abusive and neglectful as her parents. This well known psychological phenomenon is [[null|]]called _repetition compulsion_ or _reenactment,_ and trauma survivors are extremely susceptible to it. We will explore this extensively throughout the book.  
  
不幸的是，尽管 Carol 似乎已经逃离了家庭，但她成年后情况进一步恶化。Carol 通过陷入与父母一样虐待和忽视她的自恋者纠缠，在象征意义上仍然被家庭束缚。这种众所周知的心理现象被称为重复强迫或重演，创伤幸存者对此极为易感。我们将在整本书中深入探讨这一点。

A third child, Maude, was born two years after Carol. By this time, her parents were worn out from incessantly molding Bob and Carol. Having whipped Bob and Carol into hero- and scapegoat-shape, they had little use for Maude. They did not have enough energy or interest left to whip her into anything.  
  
Carol 出生两年后，又生了一个孩子，名叫 Maude。这时，她的父母已经因为不断地塑造 Bob 和 Carol 而筋疲力尽。在将 Bob 和 Carol 塑造成英雄和替罪羊之后，他们对 Maude 几乎没有兴趣。他们剩下的精力和兴趣都不足以将她塑造成任何东西。

Maude became the classic lost child and was left on her own to raise herself. She soon discovered food and daydreaming as her sole sources of comfort. However, because Bob also enjoyed using her for target practice, she stayed in her room as much as possible.  
  
Maude 成为了典型的失落的孩子，被独自留下自己抚养自己。她很快发现了食物和白日梦是她唯一的安慰来源。然而，因为 Bob 也喜欢用她作为射击目标，她尽可能地待在自己的房间里。

In retrospect, Carol also thought that Bob was molesting Maude. She hypothesized that these two factors contributed to the fact that Maude could not tolerate the various nurseries and pre-schools in which her mother tried to dump her. Over time, Maude numbed out into a low grade dissociative depression, and felt extremely anxious and avoidant whenever she was in a social situation.  
  
回顾过去，Carol 也认为 Bob 在骚扰 Maude。她推测这两个因素导致了 Maude 无法忍受她母亲试图将她送入的各种托儿所和幼儿园。随着时间的推移，Maude 逐渐麻木，陷入了一种低级别的解离性抑郁症，每当她处于社交场合时，都会感到极度焦虑和回避。

At four, an eccentric aunt gave Maude a television for her room and she was soon entranced. She was forced to develop an attachment disorder in which she bonded with TV rather than with a human being. Sadly, she is still lost in that relationship living on disability in an apartment cluttered with an enormous amount of useless hoarded material.  
  
四岁时，一个古怪阿姨给了 Maude 一台电视放在她的房间里，她很快就被迷住了。她被迫发展出一种依恋障碍，与电视而不是与人建立联系。遗憾的是，她仍然沉浸在这种关系中，靠残疾救济金生活在一个堆满了大量无用囤积物的公寓里。
