关于创伤的更多内容**

Trauma occurs when attack or abandonment triggers a fight/flight response so intensely that the person cannot turn it off once the threat is over. He becomes stuck in an adrenalized state. His sympathetic nervous system is locked “on” and he cannot toggle into the relaxation function of the parasympathetic nervous system.  
  
创伤发生在攻击或遗弃触发强烈的战斗/逃跑反应，以至于在威胁结束后，人们无法将其关闭。他陷入了一种肾上腺素化的状态。他的交感神经系统被锁定在“开启”状态，他无法切换到副交感神经系统的放松功能。

One common instance of this occurs when a child is attacked and hurt by a bully after school. He may remain in a hypervigilant, fearful state until someone takes action to insure him that he will not be revictimized, and until someone helps him release the hyperactivation in his nervous system.  
  
这种情况的一个常见例子是，当孩子放学后被欺凌和伤害时。他可能保持高度警惕和恐惧的状态，直到有人采取行动确保他不会再次受到伤害，直到有人帮助他释放神经系统中过度激活的部分。

If the child has learned through experience that he can come to at least one of his parents when he is hurting, frightened or needing help, he will tell mom or dad about it. With them, he will grieve the temporary death of his sense of safety in the world by verbally [[null|]]ventilating, crying and angering about it \[[11. Grieving|chapter 11]] expands on these processes of grieving\].  
  
如果孩子通过经验知道当他受伤、害怕或需要帮助时，至少可以找到一位父母，他就会告诉妈妈或爸爸。和他们在一起，他会通过言语宣泄、哭泣和愤怒来表达对世界安全感暂时丧失的悲伤\[第 11 章详细阐述了这些悲伤过程\]。

Moreover, his parent will report the bully and take steps to assure that it will not happen again, and the child will typically be released from the trauma. He will naturally relax back into the safety of parasympathetic nervous system functioning.  
  
此外，父母会报告欺凌者并采取措施确保不再发生此类事件，孩子通常也会从创伤中解脱出来。他自然会放松回到副交感神经系统的安全状态。

“Simple”, one incident traumas can often be resolved relatively easily if Cptsd is not already present.  
  
“简单”，如果创伤性应激障碍（Cptsd）尚未出现，一次性的创伤事件通常可以相对容易地解决。

If however the bullying happens on numerous occasions and the child does not seek help, or if the child lives in an environment so dangerous that the parent is powerless to ensure a modicum of safety, it may take more than parental comforting to release the trauma. If the trauma is not too continuous over too long a time, a short course of therapy may be all that is needed to resolve the trauma, provided of course the danger in the environment can effectively be remediated.  
  
然而，如果欺凌事件频繁发生，孩子没有寻求帮助，或者孩子生活在如此危险的环境中，父母无力确保一定程度的安，那么可能需要比父母的安慰更多的方法来释放创伤。如果创伤不是在很长的时间内连续发生，那么一段短期的治疗可能就足够解决创伤，当然前提是环境中的危险能够得到有效解决。

When the trauma however is repetitive and ongoing and no help is available, the child may become so frozen in trauma that the symptoms of “simple” ptsd begin to set in. This can also occur during the prolonged trauma of combat or entrapment in a cult or domestic violence situation.  
  
然而，当创伤是重复的、持续的，且没有可用的帮助时，孩子可能会在创伤中变得如此僵化，以至于“简单”的 PTSD 症状开始出现。这种情况也可能发生在长期的战斗或陷入邪教或家庭暴力情况中。

If however, a person is also afflicted by ongoing family abuse or profound emotional abandonment, the trauma will manifest as a particularly severe emotional flashback because he already has Cptsd. This is particularly true when his parent is also a bully.  
  
然而，如果一个人还受到持续的家族虐待或深刻的情感遗弃，创伤将表现为特别严重的情感闪回，因为他已经患有 CPTSD。这尤其在他父母也是欺凌者时更为真实。
