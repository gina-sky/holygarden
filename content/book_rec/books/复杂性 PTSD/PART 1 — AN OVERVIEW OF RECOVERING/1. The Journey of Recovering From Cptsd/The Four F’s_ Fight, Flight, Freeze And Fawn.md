**The Four F’s: Fight, Flight, Freeze And Fawn  
  
四 F 原则：战斗、逃跑、僵化和讨好**

Earlier, I mentioned the fight/flight response that is an innate automatic response to danger in all human beings. A more complete and accurate description of this instinct is the fight/flight/freeze/fawn response. The complex nervous system wiring of this response allows a person in danger to react in four different ways.  
  
之前，我提到了人类面对危险时的本能自动反应——战斗/逃跑反应。这种本能的更完整和准确的描述是战斗/逃跑/僵化/讨好反应。这种复杂的神经系统接线使得处于危险中的人能够以四种不同的方式反应。

[[null|]]A fight response is triggered when a person suddenly responds aggressively to something threatening. A flight response is triggered when a person responds to a perceived threat by fleeing, or symbolically, by launching into hyperactivity. A freeze response is triggered when a person, realizing resistance is futile, gives up, numbs out into dissociation and/or collapses as if accepting the inevitability of being hurt. A fawn response is triggered when a person responds to threat by trying to be pleasing or helpful in order to appease and forestall an attacker. This fourfold response potential will heretofore be referred to as the 4Fs.  
  
当一个人突然对威胁性事物做出攻击性反应时，会触发战斗反应。当一个人通过逃跑或象征性地通过过度活跃来应对感知到的威胁时，会触发逃跑反应。当一个人意识到抵抗是徒劳的，放弃，麻木地进入解离状态，或像接受受伤的必然性一样崩溃时，会触发冻结反应。当一个人试图取悦或帮助以安抚和阻止攻击者时，会触发屈服反应。这种四种反应潜力将从此被称为 4Fs。

Traumatized children often over-gravitate to one of these response patterns to survive, and as time passes these four modes become elaborated into entrenched defensive structures that are similar to narcissistic \[fight\], obsessive/compulsive \[flight\], dissociative \[freeze\] or codependent \[fawn\] defenses.  
  
创伤儿童常常过度倾向于这些反应模式之一以生存，随着时间的推移，这四种模式会发展成为根深蒂固的防御结构，类似于自恋的\[战斗\]、强迫性/强迫性的\[逃跑\]、解离性的\[冻结\]或相互依赖的\[屈服\]防御。

These structures help children survive their horrific childhoods, but leave them very limited and narrow in how they respond to life. Even worse, they remain locked in these patterns in adulthood when they no longer need to rely so heavily on one primary response pattern.  
  
这些结构帮助孩子度过恐怖的童年，但让他们在应对生活时非常有限和狭隘。更糟糕的是，他们在成年后仍然被困在这些模式中，尽管他们不再需要如此严重地依赖一种主要反应模式。

It is important to understand that variances in the childhood abuse/neglect patterns, birth order, and genetic predispositions result in people polarizing to their particular 4F type.  
  
重要的是要理解，童年虐待/忽视模式、出生顺序和遗传倾向的差异导致人们极化到他们特定的 4F 类型。

In the next section we will explore examples of how children are driven into these defenses by traumatizing parents. The four children in the vignette below match the four basic types of trauma survivors:  
  
在下一节中，我们将探讨父母如何通过创伤驱使孩子进入这些防御机制。以下案例中的四个孩子符合四种基本创伤幸存者类型：

Bob=Fight - Narcissistic  
  
鲍勃=战斗 - 自恋

Carol=Flight - Obsessive/Compulsive  
  
Carol=飞行 - 强迫症/强迫性

Maude=Freeze - Dissociative  
  
Maude=冻结 - 解离性

Sean=Fawn - Codependent  
  
Sean=屈服 - 依赖性
