**Toxic Shame: The Veneer Of An Emotional Flashback  
  
有毒羞耻感：情感闪回的假象**

_Toxic shame,_ explored enlighteningly by John Bradshaw in _Healing The Shame That Binds,_ obliterates a Cptsd survivor’s self-esteem [[null|]]with an overwhelming sense that he is loathsome, ugly, stupid, or fatally flawed. Overwhelming self-disdain is typically a flashback to the way he felt when suffering the contempt and visual skewering of his traumatizing parent. Toxic shame can also be created by constant parental neglect and rejection.  
  
有毒羞耻感，在《治愈束缚我们的羞耻》一书中被约翰·布拉德肖启迪性地探讨，它用一种压倒性的感觉摧毁了创伤后应激障碍幸存者的自尊，让他觉得自己令人厌恶、丑陋、愚蠢或致命地有缺陷。压倒性的自我厌恶通常是对他在遭受创伤性父母的轻蔑和视觉讽刺时感受的回忆。有毒羞耻感也可能是由持续的家长忽视和拒绝造成的。

Early in my career I worked with David, a handsome, intelligent man who was a professional actor. One day David came to see me after an unsuccessful audition. Beside himself, he burst out: “I never let on to anyone, but I know that I’m really very ugly. It is so stupid that I’m trying to be an actor when I’m so painful to look at.” I will never forget how shocked and disbelieving I felt at first, that such a handsome person could feel ugly, but further exploration brought me understanding.  
  
在我职业生涯的早期，我曾与大卫合作过，他是一位英俊、聪明的专业演员。有一天，大卫在一场失败的试镜后来看我。他情绪激动，爆发道：“我从未向任何人透露过，但我知道我真的很丑。我试图成为一个演员，而看起来如此痛苦，这真是太愚蠢了。”我永远不会忘记我最初感到多么震惊和难以置信，这样一个英俊的人会觉得自己丑陋，但进一步的探索让我理解了。

David’s childhood was characterized by broad spectrum abuse and neglect. He was the last and unwanted child of a large family, and his alcoholic father repeatedly attacked and looked at him with disgust. To make matters worse, his family imitated his father and frequently humiliated him with heavy doses of contempt. His older brother’s favorite gibe, accompanied by a nauseated grimace, was “I can’t stand sight of you. You make me want to vomit!”  
  
大卫的童年被广泛的虐待和忽视所定义。他是大家庭中的最后一个、不受欢迎的孩子，他的酒鬼父亲反复攻击他，并带着厌恶看着他。更糟糕的是，他的家人模仿他的父亲，经常用大量的轻蔑来羞辱他。他哥哥最喜欢的话，伴随着令人作呕的皱眉，是“我无法忍受看到你。你让我想吐！”

Toxic shame _can_ obliterate your self-esteem in the blink of an eye. In an emotional flashback you can regress instantly into feeling and thinking that you are as worthless and contemptible as your family perceived you. When you are stranded in a flashback, toxic shame devolves into the intensely painful alienation of the abandonment mélange - a roiling morass of shame, fear and depression.  
  
有毒的羞耻感可以在一瞬间摧毁你的自尊。在情感闪回中，你可以瞬间回到感觉和思考你和你家人认为你一样毫无价值、令人厌恶的状态。当你被困在闪回中时，有毒的羞耻感会转化为被遗弃混合体——一种充满羞耻、恐惧和抑郁的痛苦疏离感。

The _abandonment mélange_ is the fear and toxic shame that surrounds and interacts with the abandonment depression. The _abandonment depression_ itself is the deadened feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that afflicts traumatized children.  
  
被遗弃混合体是围绕和与被遗弃抑郁症相互作用的恐惧和有毒的羞耻感。被遗弃抑郁症本身是创伤儿童所遭受的无助和绝望的麻木感觉。

Toxic shame also inhibits us from seeking comfort and support. In a reenactment of the childhood abandonment we are flashing back to, we often isolate ourselves and helplessly surrender to an overwhelming feeling of humiliation.  
  
有毒的羞耻感也阻碍了我们寻求安慰和支持。在我们回想起的童年被遗弃的场景中，我们常常孤立自己，无助地屈服于一种压倒性的羞辱感。

If you are stuck viewing yourself as worthless, defective, or despicable, you are probably in an emotional flashback. This is typically also true when you are lost in self-hate and virulent self-criticism. Immediate help for managing emotional flashbacks can be found at the beginning of [[8. Managing Emotional Flashbacks|chapter 8]] which lists 13 practical steps for resolving flashbacks.  
  
如果你将自己视为毫无价值、有缺陷或卑鄙，你很可能正处于情感回溯中。当你陷入自我仇恨和恶毒的自我批评时，通常也是如此。在第八章的开头可以找到管理情感回溯的即时帮助，其中列出了 13 个解决回溯的实用步骤。

Numerous clients and respondents to my website tell me that the concept of _emotional flashback_ brings them a great sense of relief. They report that for the first time they are able to make some sense of their troubled lives. A common comment has been “Now I understand why all the psychological and spiritual approaches I have pursued had so few answers for me.” Many also note feeling freed from a shaming list of misdiagnoses that have been given to them by themselves or others. This in turn has aided them in ridding themselves of the self-destructive habit of amassing evidence of their own defectiveness or craziness. Many also report a quantum leap in their motivation to challenge the learned habits of self-hate and self-disgust.  
  
众多客户和我的网站受访者告诉我，情感闪回的概念给他们带来了极大的解脱感。他们表示，这是他们第一次能够对困扰自己生活的某些方面有所理解。一个常见的评论是：“现在我明白为什么我追求的所有心理和精神方法都给我这么少的答案。”许多人也提到，他们从自己或他人给予的羞辱性误诊名单中解脱出来。这反过来帮助他们摆脱了自我毁灭的习惯，即积累自己缺陷或疯狂的证据。许多人还报告说，他们在挑战自我仇恨和自我厌恶的固有习惯方面的动力有了飞跃。
