**Origins Of Cptsd  
  
Cptsd 的起源**

How do traumatically abused and/or abandoned children develop Cptsd?  
  
如何发展出创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）？

While the origin of Cptsd is most often associated with extended periods of physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood, my observations convince me that ongoing verbal and emotional abuse also causes it.  
  
虽然创伤后应激障碍（Cptsd）的起源通常与童年时期长时间的肉体和/或性虐待有关，但我的观察使我确信，持续的言语和情感虐待也会导致其产生。

Many dysfunctional parents react contemptuously to a baby or toddler’s plaintive call for connection and attachment. Contempt is extremely traumatizing to a child, and at best, extremely noxious to an adult.  
  
许多功能失调的父母会对婴儿或幼儿的哀求性呼唤联系和依恋表现出轻蔑。轻蔑对儿童来说极为创伤性，至多对成人来说也是极具伤害性的。

Contempt is a toxic cocktail of verbal and emotional abuse, a deadly amalgam of denigration, rage and disgust. Rage creates fear, and disgust creates shame in the child in a way that soon teaches her to refrain from crying out, from ever asking for attention. Before long, the child gives up on seeking any kind of help or connection at all. The child’s bid for bonding and acceptance is thwarted, and she is left to suffer in the frightened despair of abandonment.  
  
轻蔑是一种言语和情感虐待的毒药混合物，是一种诋毁、愤怒和厌恶的致命合金。愤怒产生恐惧，厌恶产生羞耻，这些都会在儿童身上产生，很快就会教会她不要哭泣，不要寻求关注。不久，孩子就会放弃寻求任何形式的帮助或联系。孩子的寻求联结和接纳的努力被挫败，她只能留在被遗弃的恐惧绝望中。

Particularly abusive parents deepen the abandonment trauma by linking corporal punishment with contempt. Slaveholders and prison guards typically use contempt and scorn to destroy their victims’ self-esteem. Slaves, prisoners, and children, who are made to feel worthless and powerless devolve into learned helplessness and can be controlled with far less energy and attention. Cult leaders also use contempt to shrink their followers into absolute submission after luring them in with brief phases of fake unconditional love.  
  
尤其是虐待成性的父母，通过将体罚与轻蔑联系起来，加深了被遗弃的创伤。奴隶主和监狱守卫通常使用轻蔑和蔑视来摧毁受害者的自尊心。奴隶、囚犯和孩子们，当他们感到毫无价值和无能为力时，会陷入习得性无助，可以用远少的精力和注意力来控制他们。精神领袖也会在用短暂的虚假无条件的爱吸引他们之后，使用轻蔑来将他们的追随者压缩到绝对服从的状态。

Furthermore, Cptsd can also be caused by emotional neglect alone. This key theme is explored at length in [[5. What if I Was Never Hit_|chapter 5]]. If you notice that [[null|]]you are berating yourself because your trauma seems insignificant compared to others, please skip ahead to this chapter and resume reading here upon completion.  
  
此外，创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）也可能仅由情感忽视引起。这一关键主题在第 5 章中进行了详细探讨。如果你发现自己因为自己的创伤似乎比别人的微不足道而责备自己，请跳过这一章，完成阅读后再继续。

Emotional neglect also typically underlies most traumatizations that are more glaringly evident. Parents who routinely ignore or turn their backs on a child’s calls for attention, connection or help, abandon their child to unmanageable amounts of fear, and the child eventually gives up and succumbs to depressed, death-like feelings of helplessness and hopelessness.  
  
情感忽视通常也是大多数更加明显的创伤背后的原因。父母如果经常忽视或对孩子的寻求关注、联系或帮助置之不理，就会让孩子陷入无法管理的恐惧之中，孩子最终会放弃，陷入抑郁、死亡般的无力感和绝望感。

These types of rejection simultaneously magnify the child’s fear, and eventually add a coating of shame to it. Over time this fear and shame begets a toxic inner critic that holds the child, and later the adult, totally responsible for his parents’ abandonment, until he becomes his own worst enemy and descends into the bowels of Cptsd.  
  
这些类型的拒绝同时放大了孩子的恐惧，最终给它加上了一层羞耻感。随着时间的推移，这种恐惧和羞耻感孕育出一个有毒的内心批评家，它让孩子，后来是成人，完全为自己的父母遗弃负责，直到他成为自己最可怕的敌人，陷入 Cptsd 的深渊。
