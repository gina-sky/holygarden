**What You May Have Been Misdiagnosed With  
  
你可能被误诊的疾病**

I once heard renowned traumatologist, John Briere, quip that if Cptsd were ever given its due, the DSM \[The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\] used by all mental health professionals would shrink from its dictionary like size to the size of a thin pamphlet. In other words, the role of traumatized childhoods in most adult psychological disorders is enormous.  
  
我曾听著名创伤学家约翰·布瑞尔开玩笑说，如果创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）得到应有的重视，所有心理健康专业人士使用的《精神疾病诊断与统计手册》（DSM）将像字典一样缩小到薄册的大小。换句话说，创伤性童年在大多数成人心理障碍中的作用是巨大的。

I have witnessed many clients with Cptsd misdiagnosed with various anxiety and depressive disorders. Moreover, many are also [[null|]]unfairly and inaccurately labeled with bipolar, narcissistic, codependent, autistic spectrum and borderline disorders. \[This is not to say that Cptsd does not sometimes co-occur with these disorders.\]  
  
我见证了许多被误诊为各种焦虑和抑郁障碍的 Cptsd（创伤后应激障碍）患者。此外，许多人还被不公平和不准确地贴上了双相、自恋、共生、自闭症谱系和边缘性障碍的标签。\[这并不是说 Cptsd 有时不会与这些障碍同时发生。\]

Further confusion also arises in the case of ADHD \[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder\], as well as obsessive/compulsive disorder, both of which are sometimes more accurately described as fixated flight responses to trauma \[see the [[The Four F’s_ Fight, Flight, Freeze And Fawn|4F’s]] below\]. This is also true of ADD \[Attention Deficit Disorder\] and some depressive and dissociative disorders which similarly can more accurately be described as fixated freeze responses to trauma.  
  
在 ADHD（注意力缺陷多动障碍）和强迫症的情况下，也会出现进一步的混淆，这两种情况有时可以更准确地描述为对创伤的固定逃避反应\[见下文的 4F\]。这也适用于 ADD（注意力缺陷障碍）以及一些抑郁和解离性障碍，这些障碍同样可以更准确地描述为对创伤的固定冻结反应。

Furthermore, this is not to say that those so misdiagnosed do not have issues that are similar and correlative with the disorders above. The key point is that these labels are incomplete and unnecessarily shaming descriptions of what the survivor is actually afflicted with.  
  
此外，这并不是说那些被误诊的人没有与上述障碍相似和相关的问题。关键点是，这些标签是不完整且不必要的羞辱性描述，描述了幸存者实际上所遭受的疾病。

Reducing Cptsd to “panic disorder” is like calling food allergies chronically itchy eyes. Over-focusing treatment on the symptoms of panic in the former case and eye health in the latter does little to get at root causes. Feelings of panic or itchiness in the eyes can be masked with medication, but all the associated problems that cause these symptoms will remain untreated.  
  
将 Cptsd 归为“恐慌症”就像把食物过敏称为慢性痒眼一样。过度关注前者恐慌的症状和后者眼健康，对找到根本原因帮助不大。恐慌或眼睛痒的感觉可以通过药物掩盖，但所有导致这些症状的相关问题都将得不到治疗。

Moreover, most of the diagnoses mentioned above are typically treated as innate characterological defects rather than as learned maladaptations to stress – adaptations that survivors were forced to learn as traumatized children. And, most importantly, because these adaptations were learned, they can often be extinguished or significantly diminished, and replaced with more functional adaptations to stress.  
  
此外，上述大多数诊断通常被视为天生的性格缺陷，而不是作为对压力的学习性不良适应——这些适应是幸存者在受到创伤的儿童时期被迫学习的。最重要的是，因为这些适应是学习得来的，它们通常可以被消除或显著减少，并替换为更有效的压力适应。

In this vein, I believe that many substance and process addictions also begin as misguided, maladaptations to parental abuse and abandonment. They are early adaptations that are attempts to soothe and distract from the mental, emotional and physical pain of Cptsd.  
  
在这方面，我认为许多物质和过程成瘾也始于对父母虐待和遗弃的错误、不良适应。它们是早期的适应，试图缓解和分散 Cptsd 在心理、情感和身体上的痛苦。
